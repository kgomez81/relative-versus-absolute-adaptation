  abstract = {Social insects are important models for social evolution and behavior. However, in many species, experimental control over important factors that regulate division of labor, such as genotype and age, is limited [1, 2]. Furthermore, most species have fixed queen and worker castes, making it difficult to establish causality between the molecular mechanisms that underlie reproductive division of labor, the hallmark of insect societies [3]. Here we present the genome of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, a powerful new study system that does not suffer from these constraints. Using cytology and RAD-seq, we show that C. biroi reproduces via automixis with central fusion and that heterozygosity is lost extremely slowly. As a consequence, nestmates are almost clonally related (r = 0.996). Workers in C. biroi colonies synchronously alternate between reproduction and brood care, and young workers eclose in synchronized cohorts. We show that genes associated with division of labor in other social insects are conserved in C. biroi and dynamically regulated during the colony cycle. With unparalleled experimental control over an individual's genotype and age, and the ability to induce reproduction and brood care [4, 5], C. biroi has great potential to illuminate the molecular regulation of division of labor. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The time-scale for the evolution of additive genetic variance-covariance matrices (G-matrices) is a crucial issue in evolutionary biology. If the evolution of G-matrices is slow enough, we can use standard multivariate equations to model drift and selection response on evolutionary time scales. We compared the G-matrices for meristic traits in two populations of gaiter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) with an apparent separation time of 2 million years. Despite considerable divergence in the meristic traits, foraging habits, and diet, these populations show conservation of structure in their G-matrices. Using Flury's hierarchial approach to matrix comparisons, we found that the populations have retained the principal components (eigenvectors) of their G-matrices, but their eigenvalues have diverged. In contrast, we were unable to reject the hypothesis of equal environmental matrices (E-matrices) for these populations. We propose that a conserved pattern of multivariate stabilizing selection may have contributed to conservation of G- and E-matrix structure during the divergence of these populations.},

abstract = {The methods of quantitative genetics may be useful for quantifying constraints on the rate and direction of response to selection in natural plant populations. We review the assumptions necessary for accurate estimation and significance testing of quantitative-genetic parameters, and consider when such estimates may accurately predict a response to selection. Estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations can provide good predictions of a long-term response to selection if (1) such estimates are reasonably accurate; (2) many genes contribute to genetic variances and covariances; (3) genetic variance-covariance matrices remain approximately constant through time (when major genes are important sources of variation, when selection is strong, or when populations are small, then rapid alterations in gene frequencies may occur, with consequent changes in the quantitative-genetic parameters); (4) genotype-environment interaction does not alter genetic parameters in new or unmeasured environments; and (5) populations are not inbred. The importance of these assumptions depends on the evolutionary scale of the questions we wish to ask. We discuss evolutionary interpretations of heritabilities and genetic correlations, emphasizing that the plasticity of quantitative-genetic parameters and the imprecision of their estimates are serious problems in the study of natural plant populations. It is important to separate the fundamental, long-term genetic constraints, which limit species evolution, from the transient genetic correlations that may be found in a particular population. It is unclear whether natural populations ever reach equilibrium conditions, in which the additive genetic variance for fitness is depleted. Under many circumstances it is difficult to deduce the past history of selection from the genetic architecture of metrical traits.},

A bivariate pattern of selection acts to correlate the characters and, without pleiotropy, their genetic correlation is due entirely to linkage disequilibrium. Data on spontaneous mutation, the effective number of genes, and the intensity of natural selection on quantitative characters are used to evaluate the models. It is concluded that, even when selection favors a high correlation between the characters, with random mating and no linkage between loci influencing different traits the genetic correlation between characters is likely to be small in magnitude. A genetic correlation of large magnitude can be maintained only if the loci influencing different characters are tightly linked, or there is a high level of inbreeding in the population created by frequent mating between closely related individuals.},

abstract = {Understanding how our use of antimicrobial drugs shapes future levels of drug resistance is crucial. Recently, there has been debate over whether an aggressive (i.e., high dose) or more moderate (i.e., lower dose) treatment of individuals will most limit the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate how one can understand and resolve these apparently contradictory conclusions. We show that a key determinant of which treatment strategy will perform best at the individual level is the extent of effective competition between resistant and sensitive pathogens within a host. We extend our analysis to the community level, exploring the spectrum between strict inter-strain competition and strain independence. From this perspective as well, we find that the magnitude of effective competition between resistant and sensitive strains determines whether an aggressive approach or moderate approach minimizes the burden of resistance in the population.},

@article{Bulmer1971,
abstract = {If a metric character is determined by an effectively infinite number of loci, selection cannot cause any permanent change in the genetic variance but will cause a temporary change which is rapidly reversed when selection ceases. This change is due entirely to the correlation between pairs of loci which is induced by selection; the correlation is negative, leading to a reduction in the genetic variance under stabilizing or directional selection, and is positive, leading to an increase in the variance under disruptive selection. When selection ceases, the correlation rapidly disappears as joint equilibrium at pairs of loci is reestablished, and the variance returns to its original value. An expression is derived for the predicted amount of change in the genetic variance due to disequilibrium in the absence of linkage. The change is likely to be small under selection intensities found under natural conditions, but it may be appreciable under intense artificial selection. This limiting result shows that the magnitude of any permanent change in the variance due to selection must decrease as the number of loci involved increases and that, when the number of loci is large, it is likely to be much less than the temporary change due to disequilibrium.},

We provide exact recursions for the dynamics of allele frequencies and linkage disequilibria (nonrandom associations of alleles across loci). When selection is weak relative to recombination, our recursions provide simple approximations for the linkage disequilibria among arbitrary combinations of loci. We show how previous models of sex-independent natural selection on diploids, assortative mating between haploids, and sexual selection on haploids can be analyzed in this framework. Using our weak-selection approximations, we derive new results concerning the coevolution of male traits and female preferences under natural and sexual selection. In particular, we provide general expressions for the intensity of linkage-disequilibrium induced selection experienced by loci that contribute to female preferences for specific male traits. Our general results support the previous observation that these indirect selection forces are so weak that they are unlikely to dominate the evolution of preference-producing loci.},

abstract = {The risk of antibiotic resistance evolution in parasites is a major problem for public health. Identifying factors which promote antibiotic resistance evolution is thus a priority in evolutionary medicine. The rate at which new mutations enter the parasite population is one important predictor; however, mutation rate is not necessarily a fixed quantity, as is often assumed, but can itself evolve. Here we explore the possible impacts of mutation rate evolution on the fate of a disease circulating in a host population, which is being treated with drugs, the use of which varies over time. Using an evolutionary rescue framework, we find that mutation rate evolution provides a dramatic increase in the probability that a parasite population survives treatment in only a limited region, while providing little or no advantage in other regions. Both epidemiological features, such as the virulence of infection, and population genetic parameters, such as recombination rate, play important roles in determining the probability of evolutionary rescue and whether mutation rate evolution enhances the probability of evolutionary rescue or not. While efforts to curtail mutation rate evolution in parasites may be worthwhile under some circumstances, our results suggest that this need not always be the case.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a global threat to human health, wherefore it is crucial to study the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance as well as its emergence and dissemination. One way to analyze the acquisition of de novo mutations conferring antibiotic resistance is adaptive laboratory evolution. However, various evolution methods exist that utilize different population sizes, selection strengths, and bottlenecks. While evolution in increasing drug gradients guarantees high-level antibiotic resistance promising to identify the most potent resistance conferring mutations, other selection regimes are simpler to implement and therefore allow higher throughput. The specific regimen of adaptive evolution may have a profound impact on the adapted cell state. Indeed, substantial effects of the selection regime on the resulting geno- and phenotypes have been reported in the literature. In this study we compare the geno- and phenotypes of Escherichia coli after evolution to Amikacin, Piperacillin, and Tetracycline under four different selection regimes. Interestingly, key mutations that confer antibiotic resistance as well as phenotypic changes like collateral sensitivity and cross-resistance emerge independently of the selection regime. Yet, lineages that underwent evolution under mild selection displayed a growth advantage independently of the acquired level of antibiotic resistance compared to lineages adapted under maximal selection in a drug gradient. Our data suggests that even though different selection regimens result in subtle genotypic and phenotypic differences key adaptations appear independently of the selection regime.},

abstract = {Infections with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum typically comprise multiple strains, especially in high-transmission areas where infectious mosquito bites occur frequently. However, little is known about the dynamics of mixed-strain infections, particularly whether strains sharing a host compete or grow independently. Competition between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, if it occurs, could be a crucial determinant of the spread of resistance. We analysed 1341 P. falciparum infections in children from Angola, Ghana and Tanzania and found compelling evidence for competition in mixed-strain infections: overall parasite density did not increase with additional strains, and densities of individual chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) and chloroquine-resistant (CQR) strains were reduced in the presence of competitors. We also found that CQR strains exhibited low densities compared with CQS strains (in the absence of chloroquine), which may underlie observed declines of chloroquine resistance in many countries following retirement of chloroquine as a first-line therapy. Our observations support a key role for within-host competition in the evolution of drug-resistant malaria. Malaria control and resistance-management efforts in high-transmission regions may be significantly aided or hindered by the effects of competition in mixed-strain infections. Consideration of within-host dynamics may spur development of novel strategies to minimize resistance while maximizing the benefits of control measures.},

Although these distortions may be common in nature, our understanding of how we expect purifying selection to affect patterns of molecular variation remains incomplete. Genealogical approaches such as coalescent theory have proven difficult to generalize to situations involving selection at many linked sites, unless selection pressures are extremely strong. Here, we introduce an effective coalescent theory (a {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}fitness-class coalescent{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}}) to describe the structure of genealogies in the presence of purifying selection at many linked sites. We use this effective theory to calculate several simple statistics describing the expected patterns of variation in sequence data, both at the sites under selection and at linked neutral sites. Our analysis combines a description of the allele frequency spectrum in the presence of purifying selection with the structured coalescent approach of Kaplan et al. (1988), to trace the ancestry of individuals through the distribution of fitnesses within the population. We also derive our results using a more direct extension of the structured coalescent approach of Hudson and Kaplan (1994). We find that purifying selection leads to patterns of genetic variation that are related but not identical to a neutrally evolving population in which population size has varied in a specific way in the past.},

abstract = {Evolutionary adaptation to a constant environment is often accompanied by specialization and a reduction of fitness in other environments. We assayed the ability of the Lenski Escherichia coli populations to grow on a range of carbon sources after 50,000 generations of adaptation on glucose. Using direct measurements of growth rates, we demonstrated that declines in performance were much less widespread than suggested by previous results from Biolog assays of cellular respiration. Surprisingly, there were many performance increases on a variety of substrates. In addition to the now famous example of citrate, we observed several other novel gains of function for organic acids that the ancestral strain only marginally utilized. Quantitative growth data also showed that strains with a higher mutation rate exhibited significantly more declines, suggesting that most metabolic erosion was driven by mutation accumulation and not by physiological tradeoffs. These reductions in growth by mutator strains were ameliorated by growth at lower temperature, consistent with the hypothesis that this metabolic erosion is largely caused by destabilizing mutations to the associated enzymes. We further hypothesized that reductions in growth rate would be greatest for substrates used most differently from glucose, and we used flux balance analysis to formulate this question quantitatively. To our surprise, we found no significant relationship between decreases in growth and dissimilarity to glucose metabolism. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that in a single resource environment, specialization does not mainly result as an inevitable consequence of adaptive tradeoffs, but rather due to the gradual accumulation of disabling mutations in unused portions of the genome.},

These two observations are in direct conflict as such selection should deplete genetic variation. Furthermore, the presence of genetic variation in a trait, and selection acting on that trait, is often not sufficient for the trait to respond to selection. Here, we bring together geometric perspectives on mutation, selection, and genetic variation and show how the perceived incompatibility between these two observations is a consequence of taking a trait-by-trait approach to the multivariate problem of genetic variation and selection.

abstract = {In quantitative genetics, the genetic architecture of traits, described in terms of variances and covariances, plays a major role in determining the trajectory of evolutionary change. Hence, the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix) is a critical component of modern quantitative genetics theory. Considerable debate has surrounded the issue of G-matrix constancy because unstable G-matrices provide major difficulties for evolutionary inference. Empirical studies and analytical theory have not resolved the debate. Here we present the results of stochastic models of G-matrix evolution in a population responding to an adaptive landscape with an optimum that moves at a constant rate. This study builds on the previous results of stochastic simulations of G-matrix stability under stabilizing selection arising from a stationary optimum. The addition of a moving optimum leads to several important new insights. First, evolution along genetic lines of least resistance increases stability of the orientation of the G-matrix relative to stabilizing selection alone. Evolution across genetic lines of least resistance decreases G-matrix stability. Second, evolution in response to a continuously changing optimum can produce persistent maladaptation for a correlated trait, even if its optimum does not change. Third, the retrospective analysis of selection performs very well when the mean G-matrix (?) is known with certainty, indicating that covariance between G and the directional selection gradient ? is usually small enough in magnitude that it introduces only a small bias in estimates of the net selection gradient. Our results also show, however, that the contemporary ?-matrix only serves as a rough guide to ?. The most promising approach for the estimation of ? is probably through comparative phylogenetic analysis. Overall, our results show that directional selection actually can increase stability of the G-matrix and that retrospective analysis of selection is inherently feasible. One major remaining challenge is to gain a sufficient understanding of the G-matrix to allow the confident estimation of ?.},

Flowering time, floral display and rosette size varied among populations and significant additive genetic variation within populations indicated potential to evolve in response to selection.

abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is considered a general explanation for phenotypic diversification, particularly when heterogeneity causes populations to diverge via local adaptation. Performance trade-offs, such as those stemming from antagonistic pleiotropy, are thought to contribute to the maintenance of diversity in this scenario. Specifically, alleles that promote adaptation in one environment are expected to promote maladaptation in alternative environments. Contrary to this expectation, however, alleles that underlie locally adaptive traits often fail to exhibit fitness costs in alternative environments. Here, we attempt to explain this paradox by reviewing the results of experimental evolution studies, including a new one of our own, that examined the evolution of trade-offs during adaptation to homogeneous versus heterogeneous environments. We propose that when pleiotropic effects vary, whether or not trade-offs emerge among diverging populations will depend critically on ecology. For example, adaptation to a locally homogeneous environment is more likely to occur by alleles that are antagonistically pleiotropic than adaptation to a locally heterogeneous environment, simply because selection is blind to costs associated with environments that are not experienced locally. Our literature review confirmed the resulting prediction that performance trade-offs were more likely to evolve during selection in homogeneous than heterogeneous environments. The nature of the environmental heterogeneity (spatial versus temporal) and the length of the experiment also contributed in predictable ways to the likelihood that performance trade-offs evolved.},

abstract = {To develop public-health policies that extend the lifespan of affordable anti-malarial drugs as effective treatment options, it is necessary to understand the evolutionary processes leading to the origin and spread of mutations conferring drug resistance in malarial parasites. We built a population-genetic model for the emergence of resistance under combination drug therapy. Reproductive cycles of parasites are specified by their absolute fitness determined by clinical parameters, thus coupling the evolutionary-genetic with population-dynamic processes. Initial mutations confer only partial drug-resistance. Therefore, mutant parasites rarely survive combination therapy and within-host competition is very weak among parasites. The model focuses on the early phase of such unsuccessful recurrent mutations. This ends in the rare event of mutants enriching in an infected individual from which the successful spread of resistance over the entire population is initiated. By computer simulations, the waiting time until the establishment of resistant parasites is analysed. Resistance spreads quickly following the first appearance of a host infected predominantly by mutant parasites. This occurs either through a rare transmission of a resistant parasite to an uninfected host or through a rare failure of drugs in removing ?transient? mutant alleles. The emergence of resistance is delayed with lower mutation rate, earlier treatment, higher metabolic cost of resistance, longer duration of high drug dose, and higher drug efficacy causing a stronger reduction in the sensitive and resistant parasites? fitnesses. Overall, contrary to other studies? proposition, the current model based on absolute fitness suggests that aggressive drug treatment delays the emergence of drug resistance.},

The major result is that, within a population, the responses of characters to selection in the short term differ qualitatively from those in the long term. In the short term, the responses depend on genetic correlations between characters, but in the long term they are only determined by the fitness functions of stabilizing and directional selection, independent of genetic and phenotypic correlations.

Eventually, unless subject to balancing selection pressures, alleles segregating in a population are destined to arrive at either of two endpoints, loss or fixation. The probability of fixation is influenced by several factors that may vary over space and time, and also interact with each other. Population structure (spatial separation coupled with nonrandom mating among demes) and immigration are examples of such factors (Whitlock and Gomulkiewicz 2005). In addition, selection and drift also drive the fixation process. Directional Darwinian selection favors certain genotypes at the expense of others and will enhance the spread of advantageous alleles in the population so that the likelihood for their fixation is increased. Random genetic drift on the other hand is a phenomenon that arises from a stochastic process in which sampling},

Using two long-term data sets on barn swallows Hirundo rustica (from Spain and Denmark), we show for the first time in wild populations that spring arrival dates are phenotypically and genetically correlated with morphological and life history traits. In the Danish population, length of outermost tail feathers and wing length were negatively genetically correlated with arrival date. In the Spanish population, we found a negative genetic correlation between arrival date and time elapsed between arrival date and laying date, constraining response to selection that favours both early arrival and shorter delays. This results in a decreased rate of adaptation, not because of constraints on arrival date, but constraints on delay before breeding, that is, a trait that can be equally important in the context of climate change.},

abstract = {We investigate maintenance of quantitative genetic variation at mutation-selection balance for multiple traits. The intrinsic strength of real stabilizing selection on one of these traits denoted the "target trait" and the observed strength of apparent stabilizing selection on the target trait can be quite different: the latter, which is estimable, is much smaller (i.e., implying stronger selection) than the former. Distinguishing them may enable the mutation load to be relaxed when considering multivariate stabilizing selection. It is shown that both correlations among mutational effects and among strengths of real stabilizing selection on the traits are not important unless they are high. The analysis for independent situations thus provides a good approximation to the case where mutant and stabilizing selection effects are correlated. Multivariate stabilizing selection can be regarded as a combination of stabilizing selection on the target trait and the pleiotropic direct selection on fitness that is solely due to the effects of real stabilizing selection on the hidden traits. As the overall fitness approaches a constant value as the number of traits increases, multivariate stabilizing selection can maintain abundant genetic variance only under quite weak selection. The common observations of high polygenic variance and strong stabilizing selection thus imply that if the mutation-selection balance is the true mechanism of maintenance of genetic variation, the apparent stabilizing selection cannot arise solely by real stabilizing selection simultaneously on many metric traits.},

Here we investigate the evolutionary role of epistasis over 50,000 generations in a well-studied laboratory evolution experiment in Escherichia coli. The extensive duration of this experiment provides a unique window into the effects of epistasis during long-term adaptation to a constant environment. Guided by analytical results in the weak-mutation limit, we develop a computational framework to assess the compatibility of a given epistatic model with the observed patterns of fitness gain and mutation accumulation through time. We find that a decelerating fitness trajectory alone provides little power to distinguish between competing models, including those that lack any direct epistatic interactions between mutations. However, when combined with the mutation trajectory, these observables place strong constraints on the set of possible models of epistasis, ruling out many existing explanations of the data. Instead, we find that the data are consistent with "two-epoch" model of adaptation, in which an initial burst of diminishing returns epistasis is followed by a steady accumulation of mutations under a constant distribution of fitness effects. Our results highlight the need for additional DNA sequencing of these populations, as well as for more sophisticated models of epistasis that are compatible with all of the experimental data.},

Knowledge of these features of a gene is critical to understand the molecular basis of adaptive evolution. Here we investigate the importance of pleiotropy and epistasis in determining the adaptive value of a candidate gene using the gene FRI (FRIGIDA), which is thought to be the major gene controlling flowering time variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The effect of FRI on flowering time was analyzed in an outbred population created by randomly mating 19 natural accessions of A. thaliana. This unique population allows the estimation of FRI effects independent of any linkage association with other loci due to demographic processes or to coadapted genes. It also allows for the estimation of pleiotropic effects of FRI on fitness and inflorescence architecture. We found that FRI explains less variation in flowering time than previously observed among natural accessions, and interacts epistatically with the FLC locus. Although early flowering plants produce more fruits under spring conditions, and nonfunctional alleles of FRI were associated with early flowering, variation at FRI was not associated with fitness. We show that nonfunctional FRI alleles have negative pleiotropic effects on fitness by reducing the numbers of nodes and branches on the inflorescence. We propose that these antagonistic pleiotropic effects reduce the adaptive value of FRI, and helps explain the maintenance of alternative life history strategies across natural populations of A. thaliana.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that the spread of resistance can be slowed by reducing drug treatment and hence restricting competitive release. Using the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi, we found that low-dose chemotherapy did reduce competitive release. A higher drug dose regimen exerted stronger positive selection on resistant parasites for no detectable clinical gain. We estimated instantaneous selection coefficients throughout the course of replicate infections to analyze the temporal pattern of the strength and direction of within-host selection. The strength of selection on resistance varied through the course of infections, even in untreated infections, but increased immediately following drug treatment, particularly in the high-dose groups. Resistance remained under positive selection for much longer than expected from the half life of the drug. Although there are many differences between mice and people, our data do raise the question whether the aggressive treatment regimens aimed at complete parasite clearance are the best resistance-management strategies for humans.},

abstract = {One of the oldest problems in evolutionary biology remains largely unsolved. Which mutations generate evolutionarily relevant phenotypic variation? What kinds of molecular changes do they entail? What are the phenotypic magnitudes, frequencies of origin, and pleiotropic effects of such mutations? How is the genome constructed to allow the observed abundance of phenotypic diversity? Historically, the neo-Darwinian synthesizers stressed the predominance of micromutations in evolution, whereas others noted the similarities between some dramatic mutations and evolutionary transitions to argue for macromutationism. Arguments on both sides have been biased by misconceptions of the developmental effects of mutations. For example, the traditional view that mutations of important developmental genes always have large pleiotropic effects can now be seen to be a conclusion drawn from observations of a small class of mutations with dramatic effects. It is possible that some mutations, for example, those in cis-regulatory DNA, have few or no pleiotropic effects and may be the predominant source of morphological evolution. In contrast, mutations causing dramatic phenotypic effects, although superficially similar to hypothesized evolutionary transitions, are unlikely to fairly represent the true path of evolution. Recent developmental studies of gene function provide a new way of conceptualizing and studying variation that contrasts with the traditional genetic view that was incorporated into neo-Darwinian theory and population genetics. This new approach in developmental biology is as important for microevolutionary studies as the actual results from recent evolutionary developmental studies. In particular, this approach will assist in the task of identifying the specific mutations generating phenotypic variation and elucidating how they alter gene function. These data will provide the current missing link between molecular and phenotypic variation in natural populations.},

However, while all three replicate populations of the first five selection treatments displayed a significant response, the remaining three, characterized by low genetic variance in their selection indexes in the base population, displayed inconsistent responses to selection. The observation that only four of the nine replicate populations evolved in response to the direct selection applied to them in these low genetic variance treatments, led us to conclude that a nearly null subspace did limit evolution.

abstract = {Selection is commonly described by assigning constant relative fitness values to genotypes. Yet population density is often regulated by crowding. Relative fitness may then depend on density, and selection can change density when it acts on a density-regulating trait. When strong density-dependent selection acts on a density-regulating trait, selection is no longer describable by density-independent relative fitnesses, even in demographically stable populations. These conditions are met in most previous models of density-dependent selection (e.g. ``K-selection'' in the logistic and Lotka-Volterra models), suggesting that density-independent relative fitnesses must be replaced with more ecologically explicit absolute fitnesses unless selection is weak. Here we show that density-independent relative fitnesses can also accurately describe strong density-dependent selection under some conditions. We develop a novel model of density-regulated population growth with three ecologically intuitive traits: fecundity, mortality, and competitive ability. Our model, unlike the logistic or Lotka-Volterra, incorporates a density-dependent juvenile ``reproductive excess'', which largely decouples density-dependent selection from the regulation of density. We find that density-independent relative fitnesses accurately describe strong selection acting on any one trait, even fecundity, which is both density-regulating and subject to density-dependent selection. Pleiotropic interactions between these traits recover the familiar -selection behavior. In such cases, or when the population is maintained far from demographic equilibrium, our model offers a possible alternative to relative fitness.},

The structure of a genotype-phenotype map (GP map) determines trait covariation, which involves variation in the degree and strength of the pleiotropic effects of the underlying genes. It is still unclear, and debated, how much of that structure can be deduced from variational properties of quantitative traits that are inferred from their genetic (co) variance matrix (G-matrix). Here we aim to clarify how the extent of pleiotropy and the correlation among the pleiotropic effects of mutations differentially affect the structure of a G-matrix and our ability to detect genetic constraints from its eigen decomposition. We show that the eigenvectors of a G-matrix can be predictive of evolutionary constraints when they map to underlying pleiotropic modules with correlated mutational effects. Without mutational correlation, evolutionary constraints caused by the fitness costs associated with increased pleiotropy are harder to infer from evolutionary metrics based on a G-matrix's geometric properties because uncorrelated pleiotropic effects do not affect traits' genetic correlations. Correlational selection induces much weaker modular partitioning of traits' genetic correlations in absence then in presence of underlying modular pleiotropy.},

@article{stoltzfus2006mutationism,
abstract = {The rediscovery of Mendel's laws a century ago launched the science that William Bateson called ``genetics,'' and led to a new view of evolution combining selection, particulate inheritance, and the newly characterized phenomenon of ``mutation.'' This ``mutationist'' view clashed with the earlier view of Darwin, and the later ``Modern Synthesis,'' by allowing discontinuity, and by recognizing mutation (or more properly, mutation-and-altered-development) as a source of creativity, direction, and initiative. By the mid-20th century, the opposing Modern Synthesis view was a prevailing orthodoxy: under its influence, ``evolution'' was redefined as ``shifting gene frequencies,'' that is, the sorting out of pre-existing variation without new mutations; and the notion that mutation-and-altered-development can exert a predictable influence on the course of evolutionary change was seen as heretical. Nevertheless, mutationist ideas re-surfaced: the notion of mutational determinants of directionality emerged in molecular evolution by 1962, followed in the 1980s by an interest among evolutionary developmental biologists in a shaping or creative role of developmental propensities of variation, and more recently, a recognition by theoretical evolutionary geneticists of the importance of discontinuity and of new mutations in adaptive dynamics. The synthetic challenge presented by these innovations is to integrate mutation-and-altered-development into a new understanding of the dual causation of evolutionary change-a broader and more predictive understanding that already can lay claim to important empirical and theoretical results-and to develop a research program appropriately emphasizing the emergence of variation as a cause of propensities of evolutionary change.},

abstract = {In quantitative genetics, there are two basic "conflicting" observations: abundant polygenic variation and strong stabilizing selection that should rapidly deplete that variation. This conflict, although having attracted much theoretical attention, still stands open. Two classes of model have been proposed: real stabilizing selection directly on the metric trait under study and apparent stabilizing selection caused solely by the deleterious pleiotropic side effects of mutations on fitness. Here these models are combined and the total stabilizing selection observed is assumed to derive simultaneously through these two different mechanisms. Mutations have effects on a metric trait and on fitness, and both effects vary continuously. The genetic variance (V(G)) and the observed strength of total stabilizing selection (V(s,t)) are analyzed with a rare-alleles model. Both kinds of selection reduce V(G) but their roles in depleting it are not independent: The magnitude of pleiotropic selection depends on real stabilizing selection and such dependence is subject to the shape of the distributions of mutational effects. The genetic variation maintained thus depends on the kurtosis as well as the variance of mutational effects: All else being equal, V(G) increases with increasing leptokurtosis of mutational effects on fitness, while for a given distribution of mutational effects on fitness, V(G) decreases with increasing leptokurtosis of mutational effects on the trait. The V(G) and V(s,t) are determined primarily by real stabilizing selection while pleiotropic effects, which can be large, have only a limited impact. This finding provides some promise that a high heritability can be explained under strong total stabilizing selection for what are regarded as typical values of mutation and selection parameters.},

Analysis using the Next-Generation Matrix reveals how competition within hosts and the costs of resistance determine whether vulnerable and resistant strains persist, coexist, or drive each other to extinction. Invasion analysis predicts that treatment of dually infected cases will promote resistance. By varying antibiotic strength, the models suggest that physicians have two ways to achieve a particular resistance target: prescribe relatively weak antibiotics to everyone infected with an antibiotic-vulnerable strain or give more potent prescriptions to only those patients singly infected with the vulnerable strain after ruling out the possibility of them being dually infected with resistance.

abstract = {The Lande equation forms the basis for our understanding of the short-term evolution of quantitative traits in a multivariate context. It predicts the response to selection as the product of an additive genetic variance matrix and a selection gradient. The selection gradient approximates the force and direction of selection, and the genetic variance matrix quantifies the role of the genetic system in evolution. Attempts to understand the evolutionary significance of the genetic variance matrix are hampered by the fact that the majority of the methods used to characterize and compare variance matrices have not been derived in an explicit theoretical context. We use the Lande equation to derive new measures of the ability of a variance matrix to allow or constrain evolution in any direction in phenotype space. Evolvability captures the ability of a population to evolve in the direction of selection when stabilizing selection is absent. Conditional evolvability captures the ability of a population to respond to directional selection in the presence of stabilizing selection on other trait combinations. We then derive measures of character autonomy and integration from these evolvabilities. We study the properties of these measures and show how they can be used to interpret and compare variance matrices. As an illustration, we show that divergence of wing shape in the dipteran family Drosophilidae has proceeded in directions that have relatively high evolvabilities.},

abstract = {Selection on polygenic characters is generally analyzed by statistical methods that assume a Gaussian (normal) distribution of breeding values. We present an alternative analysis based on multilocus population genetics. We use a general representation of selection, recombination, and drift to analyze an idealized polygenic system in which all genetic effects are additive (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are absent), but no assumptions are made about the distribution of breeding values or the numbers of loci or alleles. Our analysis produces three results. First, our equations reproduce the standard recursions for the mean and additive variance if breeding values are Gaussian; but they also reveal how non-Gaussian distributions of breeding values will alter these dynamics. Second, an approximation valid for weak selection shows that even if genetic variance is attributable to an effectively infinite number of loci with only additive effects, selection will generally drive the distribution of breeding values away from a Gaussian distribution by creating multilocus linkage disequilibria. Long-term dynamics of means can depart substantially from the predictions of the standard selection recursions, but the discrepancy may often be negligible for short-term selection. Third, by including mutation, we show that, for realistic parameter values, linkage disequilibrium has little effect on the amount of additive variance maintained at an equilibrium between stabilizing selection and mutation. Each of these analytical results is supported by numerical calculations.},

Recent in vivo and in vitro experimental studies of the adaptation to these ?costs of resistance? in Escherichia coli, HIV, and Salmonella typhimurium found that evolution in the absence of these drugs commonly results in the ascent of mutations that ameliorate these costs, rather than higher-fitness, drug-sensitive revertants. To ascertain the conditions under which this compensatory evolution, rather than reversion, will occur, we did computer simulations, in vitro experiments, and DNA sequencing studies with low-fitness rpsL (streptomycin-resistant) mutants of E. coli with and without mutations that compensate for the fitness costs of these ribosomal protein mutations. The results of our investigation support the hypothesis that in these experiments, the ascent of intermediate-fitness compensatory mutants, rather than high-fitness revertants, can be attributed to higher rates of compensatory mutations relative to that of reversion and to the numerical bottlenecks associated with serial passage. We argue that these bottlenecks are intrinsic to the population dynamics of parasitic and commensal microbes and discuss the implications of these results to the problem of drug resistance and adaptive evolution in parasitic and commmensal microorganisms in general.},

abstract = {Using a previously undescribed approach, we develop an analytic model that predicts whether an asexual population accumulates advantageous or deleterious mutations over time and the rate at which either process occurs. The model considers a large number of linked identical loci, or nucleotide sites; assumes that the selection coefficient per site is much less than the mutation rate per genome; and includes back and compensating mutations. Using analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our results over almost the entire range of population sizes. Two limiting cases of our results, when either deleterious or advantageous mutations can be neglected, correspond to the Fisher-Muller effect and Muller's ratchet, respectively. By comparing predictions of our model (no recombination) to those of simple single-locus models (strong recombination), we show that the accumulation of advantageous mutations is slowed by linkage over a broad, finite range of population size. This supports the view of Fisher and Muller, who argued in the 1930s that progressive evolution of organisms is slowed because loci at which beneficial mutations can occur are often linked together on the same chromosome. These results follow from our main finding, that distribution of sequences over the mutation number evolves as a traveling wave whose speed and width depend on population size and other parameters. The model explains a logarithmic dependence of steady-state fitness on the population size reported recently for an RNA virus.},

However, because of the demanding nature of G-matrix estimation and comparison in wild populations, the extent of its spatial variability remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigate spatial variation in G-matrices for morphological and life-history traits using long-term data sets from one continental and three island populations of blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) that have experienced contrasting population history and selective environment. We found no evidence for differences in G-matrices among populations. Interestingly, the phenotypic variance-covariance matrices (P) were divergent across populations, suggesting that using P as a substitute for G may be inadequate. These analyses also provide the first evidence in wild populations for additive genetic variation in the incubation period (that is, the period between last egg laid and hatching) in all four populations. Altogether, our results suggest that G-matrices may be stable across populations inhabiting contrasted environments, therefore challenging the results of previous simulation studies and laboratory experiments.},

abstract = {Previous mathematical analyses of mutation-selection balance for metric traits assume that selection acts on the relevant loci only through the character(s) under study. Thus, they implicitly assume that all of the relevant mutation and selection parameters are estimable. A more realistic analysis must recognize that many of the pleiotropic effects of loci contributing variation to a given character are not known. To explore the consequences of these hidden effects, I analyze models of two pleiotropically connected polygenic traits, denoted P1 and P2. The actual equilibrium genetic variance for P1, based on complete knowledge of all mutation and selection parameters for both P1 and P2, can be compared to a prediction based solely on observations of P1. This extrapolation mimics empirically obtainable predictions because of the inevitability of unknown pleiotropic effects. The mutation parameters relevant to P1 are assumed to be known, but selection intensity is estimated from the within-generation reduction of phenotypic variance for P1. The extrapolated prediction is obtained by substituting these parameters into formulas based on single-character analyses. Approximate analytical and numerical results show that the level of agreement between these univariate extrapolations and the actual equilibrium variance depends critically on both the genetic model assumed and the relative magnitudes of the mutation and selection parameters. Unless per locus mutation rates are extremely high, i.e., generally greater than 10-4, the widely used gaussian approximation for genetic effects at individual loci is not applicable. Nevertheless, the gaussian approximations predict that the true and extrapolated equilibria are in reasonable agreement, i.e., within a factor of two, over a wide range of parameter values. In contrast, an alternative approximation that applies for moderate and low per locus mutation rates predicts that the extrapolation will generally overestimate the true equilibrium variance unless there is little selection associated with hidden effects. The tendency to overestimate is understandable because selection acts on all of the pleiotropic manifestations of a new mutation, but equilibrium covariances among the characters affected may not reveal all of this selection. This casts doubt on the proposal that much of the additive polygenic variance observed in natural populations can be explained by mutation-selection balance. It also indicates the difficulty of critically evaluating this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Long-term phenotypic evolution can be modeled using the response-to-selection equation of quantitative genetics, which incorporates information about genetic constraints (the G matrix). However, little is known about the evolution of G and about its long-term importance in constraining phenotypic evolution. We first investigated the degree of conservation of the G matrix across three species of crickets and qualitatively compared the pattern of variation of G to the phylogeny of the group. Second, we investigated the effect of G on phenotypic evolution by comparing the direction of greatest quantitative genetic variation within species (gmax) to the direction of phenotypic divergence between species (?z?). Each species, Gryllus veletis, G. firmus, and G. pennsylvanicus, was reared in the laboratory using a full-sib breeding design to extract quantitative genetic information. Five morphological traits related to size were measured. G matrices were compared using three statistical approaches: the T method, the Flury hierarchy, and the MANOVA method. Results revealed that the differences between matrices were small and mostly caused by differences in the magnitude of the genetic variation, not by differences in principal component structure. This suggested that the G matrix structure of this group of species was preserved, despite significant phenotypic divergence across species. The small observed differences in G matrices across species were qualitatively consistent with genetic distances, whereas ecological information did not provide a good prediction of G matrix variation. The comparison of gmax and ?z? revealed that the angle between these two vectors was small in two of three species comparisons, whereas the larger angle corresponding to the third species comparison was caused in large part by one of the five traits. This suggests that multivariate phenotypic divergence occurred mostly in a direction predicted by the direction of greatest genetic variation, although it was not possible to demonstrate the causal relationship from G to ?z?. Overall, this study provided some support for the validity of the predictive power of quantitative genetics over evolutionary time scales.},

abstract = {The maintenance of polygenic variability by a balance between mutation and stabilizing selection has been analysed using two approximations: the 'Gaussian' and the 'house of cards'. These lead to qualitatively different relationships between the equilibrium genetic variance and the parameters describing selection and mutation. Here we generalize these approximations to describe the dynamics of genetic means and variances under arbitrary patterns of selection and mutation. We incorporate genetic drift into the same mathematical framework.

The effects of frequency-independent selection and genetic drift can be determined from the gradient of log mean fitness and a covariance matrix that depends on genotype frequencies. These equations describe an 'adaptive landscape', with a natural metric of genetic distance set by the covariance matrix. From this representation we can change coordinates to derive equations describing the dynamics of an additive polygenic character in terms of the moments (means, variances,...) of allelic effects at individual loci. Only under certain simplifying conditions, such as those derived from the Gaussian and house-of-cards approximations, do these general recursions lead to tractable equations for the first few phenotypic moments. The alternative approximations differ in the constraints they impose on the distributions of allelic effects at individual loci. The Gaussian-based prediction that evolution of the phenotypic mean does not change the genetic variance is shown to be a consequence of the assumption that the allelic distributions are never skewed. We present both analytical and numerical results delimiting the parameter values consistent with our approximations.},

Many biologists address evolutionary questions by estimating phenotypic selection and genetic (co)variances (G matrices). Simultaneously, an increasing number of studies have applied quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping methods to dissect variation. Both conceptual and practical difficulties have isolated these two foci of quantitative genetics. A conceptual integration follows from the recognition that QTL allele frequencies are the essential variables relating the G-matrix to marker-based mapping experiments. Breeding designs initiated from randomly selected parental genotypes can be used to estimate QTL-specific genetic (co)variances. These statistics appropriately distill allelic variation and provide an explicit population context for QTL mapping estimates. Within this framework, one can parse the G-matrix into a set of mutually exclusive genomic components and ask whether these parts are similar or dissimilar in their respective features, for example the magnitude of phenotypic effects and the extent and nature of pleiotropy. As these features are critical determinants of sustained response to selection, the integration of QTL mapping methods into G-matrix estimation can provide a concrete, genetically based experimental program to investigate the evolutionary potential of natural populations.},

Since selection acts on individuals whose fitness depends on many loci, different loci affect each other's dynamics. This leads to stochastic fluctuations of allele frequencies above and beyond genetic drift-an effect known as genetic draft. Since recombination disrupts associations between alleles, draft is strong when recombination is rare. Here, we study a facultatively outcrossing population in a regime where the frequency of outcrossing and recombination, r, is small compared to the characteristic scale of fitness differences $\sigma$. In this regime, fit genotypes expand clonally, leading to large fluctuations in the number of recombinant offspring genotypes. The power law tail in the distribution of the latter makes it impossible to capture the dynamics of draft by an effective neutral model. Instead, we find that the fixation time of a neutral allele increases only slowly with the population size but depends sensitively on the ratio r/$\sigma$. The efficacy of selection is reduced dramatically and alleles behave "quasi-neutrally" even for Nsâ«1, provided that |s| {\textless} s(c), where s(c) depends strongly on r/$\sigma$, but only weakly on population size N. In addition, the anomalous fluctuations due to draft change the spectrum of (quasi)-neutral alleles from f($\nu$) â¼ $\nu$(-1), corresponding to drift, to â¼ $\nu$(-2).

This process is called evolutionary rescue and has been studied under different names in medicine, agriculture, and conservation biology. It is a component of the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics, which investigates how the ecological attributes of species may evolve rapidly under strong selection. Its distinguishing feature is to combine the evolutionary concept of relative fitness with the ecological concept of absolute fitness in a synthetic theory of persistent adaptation. The likelihood of rescue will depend both on attributes of the population, particularly abundance and variation, and on properties of the environment, particularly the rate and severity of deterioration. Medical interventions (e.g., the administration of antibiotics), agricultural practices (e.g., the application of pesticides), and population ecology (e.g., the effects of species introductions) provide numerous examples of evolutionary rescue. The general theory of rescue has been tested in laboratory experiments with microbes, in which experimental evolution shows how different treatments affect the frequency of rescue. Overall, these experiments have supported the predictions of general theory: In particular, abundance, variation, and dispersal have pronounced and repeatable effects on the rescue of populations and communities.Extending these laboratory results to the field is a major task for future research.},

This is because it is subject to all the environmental variation in the metric traits that affect it plus additional environmental variation. There is no simple prediction regarding levels of additive genetic variance in life-history traits, which may be high at equilibrium. Several other patterns in the inheritance of life-history traits are readily predicted from the causal model. These include the strength of genetic correlations between life-history traits, levels of nonadditive genetic variance, and the inevitability of genotype-environment interaction.},

abstract = {Having multiple peaks within fitness landscapes critically affects the course of evolution, but whether their presence imposes specific requirements at the level of genetic interactions remains unestablished. Here we show that to exhibit multiple fitness peaks, a biological system must contain reciprocal sign epistatic interactions, which are defined as genetic changes that are separately unfavorable but jointly advantageous. Using Morse theory, we argue that it is impossible to formulate a sufficient condition for multiple peaks in terms of local genetic interactions. These findings indicate that systems incapable of reciprocal sign epistasis will always possess a single fitness peak. However, reciprocal sign epistasis should be pervasive in nature as it is a logical consequence of specificity in molecular interactions. The results thus predict that specific molecular interactions may yield multiple fitness peaks, which can be tested experimentally. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A general qualitative feature of such systems is that the genetic variance for the character is independent of the linkage map of the loci, provided linkage is not very tight. A particular detailed model shows that certain aspects of the genetic system are moulded by stabilizing selection while others are selectively neutral. With reference to experimental data on characters of Drosophila flies, maize, and mice, it is concluded that large amounts of genetic variation can be maintained by mutation in polygenic characters even when there is strong stabilizing selection. The properties of the model are compared with those of heterotic models with linked loci.},

I assume that genetic variance is maintained by mutation-selection balance. The relative numbers of loci that play a role in acquiring versus allocating a limiting resource play a crucial role in determining genetic covariance. If many loci are involved in acquiring a resource, genetic covariance may be either negative or positive at equilibrium, depending on the fitness function and the input of mutational variance. The form of G does not necessarily reveal the constraint on resource acquisition inherent in the system, and therefore studies estimating G do not test for the existence of life-history tradeoffs.

I derive the expected rate of adaptation (or evolvability) under randomly changing selection gradients. When directional selection gradients have an arbitrary covariance matrix, the average rate of adaptation depends on genetic correlations between traits, contrary to the isotropic case investigated in previous studies. Adaptation may be faster on average with more genetic correlation between traits, if these traits are selected to change jointly more often than the average pair of traits. However, natural selection maximizes the long-term fitness of a population, not necessarily its rate of adaptation. I therefore derive the average lag load caused by deviations of the mean phenotype from an optimum, under several forms of environmental changes typically experienced by natural populations, both stochastic and deterministic. Simple formulas are produced for how the G matrix affects long-term fitness in these contexts, and I discuss how their parameters can be estimated empirically.},

Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of accounting for its origin.},

abstract = {We develop a general population genetic framework for analyzing selection on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and disruptive selection on an additive polygenic trait. We first present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal model, in which offspring breeding values are normally distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance. These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and recombination. The population is represented by multilocus cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis. Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait, it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical deviations frequently found between predicted and observed responses to artificial selection are not caused by linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality. Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency dynamics that depend on genetic details.},

Efforts to battle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are generally focused on developing novel antibiotics. However, history shows that resistance arises regardless of the nature or potency of new drugs. Here, we propose and provide evidence for an alternate strategy to resolve this problem: inhibiting evolution. We determined that the DNA translocase Mfd is an ``evolvability factor'' that promotes mutagenesis and is required for rapid resistance development to all antibiotics tested across highly divergent bacterial species. Importantly, hypermutator alleles that accelerate AMR development did not arise without Mfd, at least during evolution of trimethoprim resistance. We also show that Mfd's role in AMR development depends on its interactions with the RNA polymerase subunit RpoB and the nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA. Our findings suggest that AMR development can be inhibited through inactivation of evolvability factors (potentially with ``anti-evolution'' drugs)-in particular, Mfd-providing an unexplored route toward battling the AMR crisis.},

However, using drugs to kill bacteria, viruses or cancer cells has the serious side effect of selecting for mutant types that survive the drug attack. A key question therefore is how one could eradicate as many cells as possible for a given acceptable risk of drug resistance evolution. We address this general question in a model of drug resistance evolution in spatial drug gradients, which recent experiments and theories have suggested as key drivers of drug resistance. Importantly, our model takes into account the influence of convection, resulting for instance from blood flow. Using stochastic simulations, we study the fates of individual resistance mutations and quantify the trade-off between the killing of wild-type cells and the rise of resistance mutations: shallow gradients and convection into the antibiotic region promote wild-type death, at the cost of increasing the establishment probability of resistance mutations. We can explain these observed trends by modeling the adaptation process as a branching random walk. Our analysis reveals that the trade-off between death and adaptation depends on the relative length scales of the spatial drug gradient and random dispersal, and the strength of convection. Our results show that convection can have a momentous effect on the rate of establishment of new mutations, and may heavily impact the efficiency of antibiotic treatment.},

Absolute deviations in covariance structure are not correlated with phenotypic divergence. Interpreted in light of other studies, the analyses suggest that deviations in covariance structure are most strongly associated with the formation of diagnosably distinct taxa and stochastic sampling of genotypes at the population level. There is no evidence for restructuring of phenotypic covariance structure in association with reproductive isolation. The results suggest that phenotypic covariances are dynamic over short time scales and do not support attempts to extrapolate genetic covariance structure to explain or predict macroevolutionary change. This study further demonstrates that branch lengths, which are not usually analyzed in detail, contain valuable evolutionary information complementary to that residing in the branching pattern.},

We use these data to make several qualitative tests of the mutation-selection balance hypothesis for the maintenance of genetic variance (MSB). To compare VM values, we use three dimensionless quantities: mutational heritability, the mutational coefficient of variation, CVM; and the ratio of the standing genetic variance to VM, VG/VM. Since genetic coefficients of variation for life history traits are larger than those for morphological traits, we predict that under MSB, life history traits should also have larger CVM. This is confirmed; life history traits have a median CVM value more than six times higher than that for morphological traits. VG/VM approximates the persistence time of mutations under MSB in an infinite population. In order for MSB to hold, VG/VM must be small, substantially less than 1000, and life history traits should have smaller values than morphological traits. VG/VM averages about 50 generations for life history traits and 100 generations for morphological traits. These observations are all consistent with the predictions of a mutation-selection balance model.},

It could promote the very evolution it is intended to retard. The guiding principle should be to impose no more selection than is absolutely necessary. We illustrate these arguments in the context of malaria; they likely apply to a wide range of infections as well as cancer and public health insecticides. Intuition is unreliable even in simple evolutionary contexts; in a social milieu where in-host competition can radically alter the fitness costs and benefits of resistance, expert opinion will be insufficient. An evidence-based approach to resistance management is required.},

@article{Kirkpatrick2009,
abstract = {A fundamental question for both evolutionary biologists and breeders is the extent to which genetic correlations limit the ability of populations to respond to selection. Here I view this topic from three perspectives. First, I propose several nondimensional statistics to quantify the genetic variation present in a suite of traits and to describe the extent to which correlations limit their selection response. A review of five data sets suggests that the total variation differs substantially between populations. In all cases analyzed, however, the effective number of dimensions is less than two: more than half of the total genetic variation is explained by a single combination of traits. Second, I consider how patterns of variation affect the average evolutionary response to selection in a random direction. When genetic variation lies in a small number of dimensions but there are a large number of traits under selection, then the average selection response will be reduced substantially from its potential maximum. Third, I discuss how a low genetic correlation between male fitness and female fitness limits the ability of populations to adapt. Data from two recent studies of natural populations suggest this correlation can diminish or even erase any genetic benefit to mate choice. Together these results suggest that adaptation (in natural populations) and genetic improvement (in domesticated populations) may often be as much constrained by patterns of genetic correlation as by the overall amount of genetic variation.},

abstract = {An absence of genetic variance in traits under selection is perhaps the oldest explanation for a limit to evolutionary change, but has also been the most easily dismissed. We review a range of theoretical and empirical results covering single traits to more complex multivariate systems, and show that an absence of genetic variance may be more common than is currently appreciated. From a single-trait perspective, we highlight that it is becoming clear that some trait types do not display significant levels of genetic variation, and we raise the possibility that species with restricted ranges may differ qualitatively from more widespread species in levels of genetic variance in ecologically important traits. A common misconception in many life-history studies is that a lack of genetic variance in single traits, and genetic constraints as a consequence of bivariate genetic correlations, are different causes of selection limits. We detail how interpretations of bivariate patterns are unlikely to demonstrate genetic limits to selection in many cases. We advocate a multivariate definition of genetic constraints that emphasizes the presence (or otherwise) of genetic variance in the multivariate direction of selection. For multitrait systems, recent results using longer term studies of organisms, in which more is understood concerning what traits may be under selection, have indicated that selection may exhaust genetic variance, resulting in a limit to the selection response.},

abstract = {The genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) is a quantity of central importance in evolutionary biology due to its influence on the rate and direction of multivariate evolution. However, the predictive power of empirically estimated G-matrices is limited for two reasons. First, phenotypes are high-dimensional, whereas traditional statistical methods are tuned to estimate and analyse low-dimensional matrices. Second, the stability of G to environmental effects and over time remains poorly understood. Using Bayesian sparse factor analysis (BSFG) designed to estimate high-dimensional G-matrices, we analysed levels variation and covariation in 10,527 expressed genes in a large (n????????????????=????????????????563) half-sib breeding design of three-spined sticklebacks subject to two temperature treatments. We found significant differences in the structure of G between the treatments: heritabilities and evolvabilities were higher in the warm than in the low-temperature treatment, suggesting more and faster opportunity to evolve in warm (stressful) conditions. Furthermore, comparison of G and its phenotypic equivalent P revealed the latter is a poor substitute of the former. Most strikingly, the results suggest that the expected impact of G on evolvability????????????????????????as well as the similarity among G-matrices????????????????????????may depend strongly on the number of traits included into analyses. In our results, the inclusion of only few traits in the analyses leads to underestimation in the differences between the G-matrices and their predicted impacts on evolution. While the results highlight the challenges involved in estimating G, they also illustrate that by enabling the estimation of large G-matrices, the BSFG method can improve predicted evolutionary responses to selection.},

In this paper, I quantify the extent to which pleiotropy inhibits the spread of alleles in response to directional selection on a focal trait. Under the assumption that pleiotropic effects are extensive and deleterious, the fraction of alleles that are beneficial overall is severely limited by pleiotropy and rises nearly linearly with the strength of directional selection on the focal trait. Over a broad class of distribution of pleiotropic effects, the mean selective effect of those alleles that are beneficial overall is halved, on average, by pleiotropy. The fraction of new mutant alleles that are beneficial overall and that succeed in fixing within a population is even more severely limited when directional selection is weak, but it rises quadratically with the strength of directional selection. Finally, the mean selective effect of mutant alleles that are beneficial and succeed in fixing is reduced by one{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}third, on average, by pleiotropy.

abstract = {Recent work has called attention to large differences among traits in the amount of standardized genetic variance they possess. There are four general factors which could play a role in causing this variation: mutation, elimination of deleterious variation, selection of favorable alleles, and balancing selection. Three factors could directly influence the mutational variability of traits: canalization, the mutational target size, and the timing of trait expression. Here I carry out simple tests of the importance of some of these factors using data from Drosophila melanogaster. I compiled information from the literature on the mutational and standing genetic variances in outbred populations, inferred the relative mutational target size of each trait, its a timing of expression, and used models of life history to calculate fitness sensitivities for each trait. Mutation variation seems to play an important role, as it is highly correlated with standing variance. The target size hypothesis was supported by a significant correlation between mutational variance and inferred target size. There was also a significant relationship between the timing of trait expression and mutational variance. These hypotheses are confounded by a correlation between timing and target size. The elimination and canalization hypotheses were not supported by these data, suggesting that they play a quantitatively less important role in determining overall variances. Additional information concerning the pleiotropic consequences of mutations would help to validate the fitness sensitivities used to test the elimination and canalization hypotheses.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTMany models of evolution calculate the rate of evolution by multiplying the rate at which new mutations originate within a population by a probability of fixation. Here we review the historical origins, contemporary applications, and evolutionary implications of these ?origin-fixation? models, which are widely used in evolutionary genetics, molecular evolution, and phylogenetics. Origin-fixation models were first introduced in 1969, in association with an emerging view of ?molecular? evolution. Early origin-fixation models were used to calculate an instantaneous rate of evolution across a large number of independently evolving loci; in the 1980s and 1990s, a second wave of origin-fixation models emerged to address a sequence of fixation events at a single locus. Although origin-fixation models have been applied to a broad array of problems in contemporary evolutionary research, their rise in popularity has not been accompanied by an increased appreciation of their restrictive assumptions or their distinctive implications. We argue that origin-fixation models constitute a coherent theory of mutation-limited evolution that contrasts sharply with theories of evolution that rely on the presence of standing genetic variation. A major unsolved question in evolutionary biology is the degree to which these models provide an accurate approximation of evolution in natural populations.},

Notes:
doi: 10.1086/677571
A1. The chief focus of this paper is origin-fixation models. 
A2. Two waves of OF models: {\~{}}1969 with Mol. Evol and then in 80's and 90s to look at sequence at loci. 
A3. OF models are a coherent theory of mutation-limited evolution compared with standing variation models.
A4. Do these models provide accurate approximation of evolution in nat. populations?

1. Two types of OF models: Aggregate rate and Sequential fixation models, both use pfix using assumption that alleles at a site fix long before next one appear. 
2. Aggregate rate models are subset of infinite sites models due to requiring mutations to appear at new sites, independent loci, and negligible standing varition in fitness, no epistasis. 
3. Sequential fixation models instead require mutation to fix or disapper long before next one appears.
4. All OF models are weak mutation (WM) models, but not all WM models are OF.
5. Start of OF thinking is molecular theory, even though its history extends back to fisher and wright.
6. WFH believe evolutionary change due to natrual selection on standing genetic variation.
7. OF requires time scales of larger than drift between mutations.
8. mid 20th century gene pool view accepted and evolution became synonomous with shift in multilocus equilibrium of segregating variation. i.e emphasis in segragating variation in evolutionary processes
9. Molecular emphasize comparing sequencess. Natural selection said to accept or reject mutations, i.e. role of filter.
Discussion
1. OF models, evol change are events in which variant is introduced by mutation and accepted or rejected based on effects.
2. OF models ignore polymorphism essential for other evolutionary phenomena.
3. OF specialized model for mutation-limited evolution.},

abstract = {A general representation of multilocus selection is extended to allow recombination to depend on genotype. The equations simplify if modifier alleles have small effects on recombination. The evolution of such modifiers only depends on how they alter recombination between the selected loci, and does not involve dominance in modifier effects. The net selection on modifiers can be found explicitly if epistasis is weak relative to recombination. This analysis shows that recombination can be favoured in two ways: because it impedes the response to epistasis which fluctuates in sign, or because it facilitates the response to directional selection. The first mechanism is implausible, because epistasis must change sign over periods of a few generations: faster or slower fluctuations favour reduced recombination. The second mechanism requires weak negative epistasis between favourable alleles, which may either be increasing, or held in check by mutation. The selection (s{\^{}} on recombination modifiers depends on the reduction in additive variance of log (fitness) due to linkage disequilibria (vx {\textless} 0), and on non-additive variance in log (fitness) (V1', V2', epistasis between 2, 3.. loci). For unlinked loci and pairwise epistasis, j , s{\_}j= -(v1 + 4V2/3)delta{\_}r, where 8r is the average increase in recombination caused by the modifier. The approximations are checked against exact calculations for three loci, and against Charlesworth's analyses of mutation/selection balance (1990), and directional selection (1993). The analysis demonstrates a general relation between selection on recombination and observable components of fitness variation, which is open to experimental test.},

abstract = {The genetic correlation is a central parameter of quantitative genetics, providing a measure of the rate at which traits respond to indirect selection (i.e., selection that does not act upon the traits under study, but some other trait with which they have genes in common). In this paper, I review the pattern of variation among four combinations of traits: life history x life history (L x L), morphological x morphological (M x M), life history x morphological (L x M), and behavioral x behavioral (B x B). A few other combinations were investigated, but insufficient data were obtained for separate analysis. A total of 1798 correlations, distributed over 51 different animal and plant species, were analyzed. The analysis was conducted at two levels: first by dividing the data set solely by trait combination, and second by blocking the data by trait combination and species. Because selection will tend to fix alleles that show positive correlations with fitness traits faster than those that are negative and because the latter are expected to arise more frequently by mutation, correlations between life-history traits are predicted to be more often negative than those between morphological traits. This prediction was supported, with the ranking in decreasing proportion of negative correlations being: L x L {\textgreater} L x M {\textgreater} B x B {\textgreater} M x M. The mean magnitude of the genetic correlation shows little variation among morphological and life-history combinations, and the distribution of values is remarkably flat. However, the estimated standard errors and the coefficient of variation (SE/rG) are large, making it difficult to separate biological factors influencing the pattern of dispersion from experimental error. Analysis of the phenotypic and genetic correlations suggest that for the combinations M x M and L x M, but not L x L or B x B, the phenotypic correlation is an adequate estimate of the genetic correlation.},

We show that one quantitative genetic model yields a good fit to data on phenotypic divergence across timescales ranging from a few generations to 10 million generations. The key feature of this model is a fitness optimum that moves within fixed limits. Conversely, a model of neutral evolution, models with a stationary optimum that undergoes Brownian or white noise motion, a model with a moving optimum, and a peak shift model all fail to account for the data on most or all timescales. We discuss our results within the framework of Simpson?s concept of adaptive landscapes and zones.

These units may either emerge spontaneously by self-organization, or may be the product of natural selection. A selection scenario that could explain the origin of modular units needs to explain the differential suppression of pleiotropic effects between different modules and the augmentation of pleiotropic effects among the elements within the module. Four scenarios are discussed: selection for adaptation rate, constructional selection, stabilizing selection and a combination of directional and stabilizing selection. It is concluded that a combination of directional and stabilizing selection is a prevalent mode of selection and a likely explanation for the evolution of modularity.},

abstract = {Quantitative genetics theory provides a framework that predicts the effects of selection on a phenotype consisting of a suite of complex traits. However, the ability of existing theory to reconstruct the history of selection or to predict the future trajectory of evolution depends upon the evolutionary dynamics of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix). Thus, the central focus of the emerging field of comparative quantitative genetics is the evolution of the G-matrix. Existing analytical theory reveals little about the dynamics of G, because the problem is too complex to be mathematically tractable. As a first step toward a predictive theory of G-matrix evolution, our goal was to use stochastic computer models to investigate factors that might contribute to the stability of G over evolutionary time. We were concerned with the relatively simple case of two quantitative traits in a population experiencing stabilizing selection, pleiotropic mutation, and random genetic drift. Our results show that G-matrix stability is enhanced by strong correlational selection and large effective population size. In addition, the nature of mutations at pleiotropic loci can dramatically influence stability of G. In particular, when a mutation at a single locus simultaneously changes the value of the two traits (due to pleiotropy) and these effects are correlated, mutation can generate extreme stability of G. Thus, the central message of our study is that the empirical question regarding G-matrix stability is not necessarily a general question of whether G is stable across various taxonomic levels. Rather, we should expect the G-matrix to be extremely stable for some suites of characters and unstable for others over similar spans of evolutionary time.},

abstract = {Asymmetry in correlated responses to selection is expected when more than one cycle of selection is practised due to changes in genetic parameters produced by selection. In large populations, under the infinitesimal model these changes are due to linkage disequilibrium generated by selection and not to gene frequency changes. This study examines the conditions under which asymmetrical correlated responses are to be expected when an infinitesimal model is considered. Asymmetrical correlated responses in two traits in respect to which trait is selected are expected if the two traits have different heritabilities. Predicted asymmetry increases with the absolute value of the genetic correlation between the two traits, the difference between the two heritabilities, the intensity of selection and the number of generations of selection. Linkage disequilibrium generated by selection should be taken into account in explaining asymmetrical correlated responses observed in selection experiments.},

  abstract  = {Because adaptation depends upon the fixation of novel beneficial mutations, the fitness effects of beneficial mutations that are substituted by selection are key to our understanding of the process of adaptation. In this study, we experimentally investigated the fitness effects of beneficial mutations that are substituted when populations of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapt to the antibiotic rifampicin. Specifically, we isolated the first beneficial mutation to be fixed by selection when 96 populations of three different genotypes of P. aeruginosa that vary considerably in fitness in the presence of rifampicin were challenged with adapting to a high dose of this antibiotic. The simple genetics of rifampicin resistance allowed us to determine the genetic basis of adaptation in the majority of our populations. We show that the average fitness effects of fixed beneficial mutations show a simple and clear pattern of diminishing returns, such that selection tends to fix mutations with progressively smaller effects as populations approach a peak on the adaptive landscape. The fitness effects of individual mutations, on the other hand, are highly idiosyncratic across genetic backgrounds, revealing pervasive epistasis. In spite of this complexity of genetic interactions in this system, there is an overall tendency toward diminishing-returns epistasis. We argue that a simple overall pattern of diminishing-returns adaptation emerges, despite pervasive epistasis between beneficial mutations, because many beneficial mutations are available, and while the fitness landscape is rugged at the fine scale, it is smooth and regular when we consider the average over possible routes to adaptation. In the context of antibiotic resistance, these results show that acquiring mutations that confer low levels of antibiotic resistance does not impose any constraint on the ability to evolve high levels of resistance.},

abstract = {The evolution of quantitative characters can be described by the equation delta z = G beta where delta z is the vector of mean responses, G is the matrix of additive genetic variances and covariances, P is the matrix of phenotypic variances and covariances and S is the vector of selection differentials. This equation can be used to predict changes in trait values or to retrospectively estimate the selection gradient and is thus a central equation of evolutionary quantitative genetics. Genetic variances and covariances will be reduced by stabilizing selection, directional selection and drift, and increased by mutation. Changes in trait values resulting from directional selection that are comparable with differences observed among species are readily obtainable in short geological time spans ({\textless}5000 generations) with selection intensities so small that they would have an insignificant effect on the G matrix (of course it is possible that such changes came about by strong selection over a few generations, followed by long periods of stasis; there is insufficient evidence to presently distinguish these two possibilities). On the other hand, observed effective population sizes are sufficiently small that considerable changes in G can be expected from drift alone. The action of drift can be distinguished from selection because the former produces a proportional change in G whereas the latter, in general, will not. A survey of studies examining variation in G suggests that the null hypothesis that most of the variation can be attributed to drift rather than selection cannot be rejected. However, more research on the predicted statistical distribution of G as a result of selection and/or drift is required and further development of statistical tests to distinguish these two forces needs to be made.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the effects of selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation (' background selection') on rates of evolution and levels of genetic diversity at weakly selected, completely linked, loci. General formulae are derived for the expected rates of gene substitution and genetic diversity, relative to the neutral case, as a function of selection and dominance coefficients at the loci in question, and of the frequency of gametes that are free of deleterious mutations with respect to the loci responsible for background selection. As in the neutral case, most effects of background selection can be predicted by considering the effective size of the population to be multiplied by the frequency of mutation-free gametes. Levels of genetic diversity can be sharply reduced by background selection, with the result that values for sites under selection approach those for neutral variants subject to the same regime of background selection. Rates of fixation of slightly deleterious mutations are increased by background selection, and rates of fixation of advantageous mutations are reduced. The properties of sex-linked and autosomal asexual and self-fertilizing populations are considered. The implications of these results for the interpretation of studies of molecular evolution and variation are discussed.},

Despite its essential importance in evolutionary studies, empirical tests of the temporal stability of the G-matrix in natural populations are few. We used a 25-year-long individual-based field study on almost 7000 breeding attempts of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) to estimate the stability of the G-matrix over time. Using animal models to estimate G for several time periods, we show that the structure of the time-specific G-matrices changed significantly over time. The temporal changes in the G-matrix were unpredictable, and the structure at one time period was not indicative of the structure at the next time period. Moreover, we show that the changes in the time-specific G-matrices were not related to changes in mean trait values or due to genetic drift. Selection, differences in acquisition/allocation patterns or environment-dependent allelic effects are therefore likely explanations for the patterns observed, probably in combination. Our result cautions against assuming constancy of the G-matrix and indicates that even short-term evolutionary predictions in natural populations can be very challenging.},

The populations that retained the ancestral mutation rate support a model in which most fixed mutations are beneficial, the fraction of beneficial mutations declines as fitness rises, and neutral mutations accumulate at a constant rate. We also compared these populations to mutation-accumulation lines evolved under a bottlenecking regime that minimizes selection. Nonsynonymous mutations, intergenic mutations, insertions and deletions are overrepresented in the long-term populations, further supporting the inference that most mutations that reached high frequency were favoured by selection.

The first is to compare evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances. Researchers should always report these statistics, so that measures of variation appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.},

Perhaps the greatest challenge in the analysis of pleiotropic genes is determining whether phenotypes associated with a mutation result from the loss of a single function or of multiple functions encoded by the same gene. Here we estimate the degree of pleiotropy in yeast by measuring the phenotypes of 4710 mutants under 21 environmental conditions, finding that it is significantly higher than predicted by chance. We use a biclustering algorithm to group pleiotropic genes by common phenotype profiles. Comparisons of these clusters to biological process classifications, synthetic lethal interactions, and protein complex data support the hypothesis that this method can be used to genetically define cellular functions. Applying these functional classifications to pleiotropic genes, we are able to dissect phenotypes into groups associated with specific gene functions.Mol Syst Biol. 1: 2005.0001},

Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39{\%} vs. 25{\%} in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.},

If the distribution is skewed, unless effects or the population size is small, the proportion of mutants that have increasing effect is the critical parameter. With linkage the distribution of genotypic values in the population becomes skewed downward and the equilibrium genetic variance and response are smaller as disequilibrium becomes important. Linkage effects are greater when the mutational variance is contributed by many genes of small effect than few of large effect, and are greater when the majority of mutants increase rather than decrease the trait because genes that are of large effect or are deleterious do not segregate for long.

abstract = {In 1996, Schluter showed that the direction of morphological divergence of closely related species is biased toward the line of least genetic resistance, represented by gmax, the leading eigenvector of the matrix of genetic variance-covariance (the G-matrix). G is used to predict the direction of evolutionary change in natural populations. However, this usage requires that G is sufficiently constant over time to have enough predictive significance. Here, we explore the alternative explanation that G can evolve due to gene flow to conform to the direction of divergence between incipient species. We use computer simulations in a mainland-island migration model with stabilizing selection on two quantitative traits. We show that a high level of gene flow from a mainland population is required to significantly affect the orientation of the G-matrix in an island population. The changes caused by the introgression of the mainland alleles into the island population affect all aspects of the shape of G (size, eccentricity, and orientation) and lead to the alignment of gmax with the line of divergence between the two populations' phenotypic optima. Those changes decrease with increased correlation in mutational effects and with a correlated selection. Our results suggest that high migration rates, such as those often seen at the intraspecific level, will substantially affect the shape and orientation of G, whereas low migration (e.g., at the interspecific level) is unlikely to substantially affect the evolution of G.},

A common approach to the empirical analysis of these matrices is the element-by-element testing of significance, and subsequent biological interpretation of pattern based on these univariate and bivariate parameters. Here, I show why this approach is likely to misrepresent the genetic basis of quantitative traits, and the selection acting on them in many cases. Diagonalization of square matrices is a fundamental aspect of many of the multivariate statistical techniques used by biologists.

* Previous studies suggest two mechanisms to explain the lack of trade-offs in situations where they are predicted by theory: differential resource acquisition and multidimensional trait constraints expressed in the presence of genetic variation. However, there is no direct empirical evidence supporting either hypothesis.

* Using individuals from multiple genotypes of the cyclic parthenogenic freshwater zooplankton, Daphnia pulicaria, we conducted life-history experiments that prevented two key aspects of these mechanisms from operating. The experiments were conducted under a range of resources from levels causing near-starvation to levels of resource abundance yielding a mean clutch size of 4-5eggs. Growth, reproduction and survival were measured for each individual.

* Contrary to expectations, we found strong positive correlations among life-history traits in the absence of both differential resource ingestion, which is one form of differential resource acquisition, and genetic variation. These positive correlations emerge from differential resource utilization, which is one of the steps along the resource ingestion-utilization-allocation pathway.

* Our results demonstrate that strong positive correlations among life-history traits emerge from variation among individuals in an underappreciated aspect of their energy budget. This alternative mechanism has different implications for understanding life-history evolution, and reinforces the potential role that physiological ecology has in shaping life-history trait correlations.},

abstract = {In finite populations subject to selection, genetic drift generates negative linkage disequilibrium, on average, even if selection acts independently (i.e., multiplicatively) upon all loci. Negative disequilibrium reduces the variance in fitness and hence, by Fisher{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s (1930) fundamental theorem, slows the rate of increase in mean fitness. Modifiers that increase recombination eliminate the negative disequilibria that impede selection and consequently increase in frequency by {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}hitchhiking.{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} Thus, stochastic fluctuations in linkage disequilibrium in finite populations favor the evolution of increased rates of recombination, even in the absence of epistatic interactions among loci and even when disequilibrium is initially absent. The method developed within this article allows us to quantify the strength of selection acting on a modifier allele that increases recombination in a finite population. The analysis indicates that stochastically generated linkage disequilibria do select for increased recombination, a result that is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Selection for a modifier that increases recombination is highest when linkage among loci is tight, when beneficial alleles rise from low to high frequency, and when the population size is small.},

The hypothesis of equal G-matrices was rejected in all comparisons and there was no evidence that the matrices differed by a proportional constant in any of the analyses. The two species matrices were found to be unrelated, both for raw data and data standardized over populations, and there was significant between-population variation in the G-matrix in both species. Populations of S. canescens showed conservation of structure (principal components) in their G-matrices, contrasting with the lack of common structure among the S. columbaria matrices. Given these observations and the results from previous studies, we propose that selection may be responsible for some of the variation between the G-matrices, at least in S.?columbaria and at the between-species level.},

abstract = {Lande's equation for predicting the response of trait means to a shift in optimal trait values is tested using a stochastic simulation model. The simulated population is finite, and each individual has a finite number of loci. Therefore, selection may cause allele frequencies and distributions to change over time. Since the equation assumes constant genetic parameters, the degree to which such allelic changes affect predictions can be examined. Predictions are based only on information available at generation zero of directional selection. The quality of the predictions depends on the nature of allelic distributions in the original population. If allelic effects are approximately normally distributed, as assumed in Lande's Gaussian approximation to the continuum-of-alleles model, the predictions are very accurate, despite small changes in the G matrix. If allelic effects have a leptokurtic distribution, as is likely in Turelli's house-of-cards approximation, the equation underestimates the rate of response and correlated response, and overestimates the time required for the trait means to reach their equilibrium values. Models with biallelic loci have limits as to the amount of trait divergence possible, since only two allelic values are available at each of a finite set of loci. If the new optimal trait values lie within these limits, predictions are good. if not, singularity in the G matrix results in suboptimal equilibria, despite the presence of genetic variance for each individual trait.},

Resistance is the result of two processes: (i) drug selection of resistant parasites; and (ii) the spread of resistance.

Here, we review theoretical models of rapid evolution in quantitative traits that can shed light on the potential for adaptation to a changing climate. Our focus is on quantitative-genetic models with selection for a moving phenotypic optimum. We point out that there is no one-to-one relationship between the rate of adaptation and population survival, because the former depends on relative fitness and the latter on absolute fitness. Nevertheless, previous estimates that sustainable rates of genetically based change usually do not exceed 0.1 haldanes (i.e., phenotypic standard deviations per generation) are probably correct. Survival can be greatly facilitated by phenotypic plasticity, and heritable variation in plasticity can further speed up genetic evolution. Multivariate selection and genetic correlations are frequently assumed to constrain adaptation, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on the geometric relationship between the fitness landscape and the structure of genetic variation. Similar conclusions hold for adaptation to shifting spatial gradients. Recent models of adaptation in multispecies communities indicate that the potential for rapid evolution is strongly influenced by interspecific competition.},

abstract = {Abstract Antimicrobial agents are generally evaluated in preclinical studies assessing in vitro activity, animal models demonstrating in vivo bacteriologic efficacy, and clinical trials primarily investigating safety and clinical efficacy. However, large sample sizes are required to detect any differences in outcomes between antimicrobials in clinical trials, and, generally, studies are powered to show only clinical equivalence. In addition, diagnosis is often based on clinical symptoms, rather than microbiological evidence of bacterial infection, and the patients most likely to have resistant pathogens are often excluded. Clinical efficacy can be achieved in some bacterial infections in which antimicrobials are suboptimal or even not prescribed. However, bacterial eradication maximizes clinical efficacy and may also reduce the development and spread of resistant organisms. The goal of antimicrobial therapy is, therefore, to eradicate bacteria at the site of infection. Bacterial eradication is not usually assessed as a primary endpoint within the limits of currently recommended clinical trial design. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) (serum concentration profiles, penetration to site of infection) and pharmacodynamic (PD) (susceptibility, concentration- versus time-dependent killing, post-antimicrobial effects) criteria can be used to predict bacteriologic efficacy. PK/PD predictions should be confirmed during all phases of antimicrobial development and throughout clinical use in response to changing patterns of resistance. A clear rationale for dose recommendations can be determined preclinically based on PK/PD parameters, and correlated with efficacy, safety and resistance endpoints in clinical trials. The duration of treatment and dose should be the shortest that will reliably eradicate the pathogen(s), and that is safe and well tolerated. Currently available agents vary significantly in their ability to achieve PK/PD parameters necessary for bacteriologic eradication. Recommendations for appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be based on PK/PD parameters, with the aim of achieving the maximum potential for eradication of both existing and emerging resistant pathogens.},

The geometry of G describes the distribution of multivariate genetic variance, and generates genetic constraints that bias the direction of evolution. Determining if and how the multivariate genetic variance evolves has been limited by a number of analytical challenges in comparing G-matrices. Current methods for the comparison of G typically share several drawbacks: metrics that lack a direct relationship to evolutionary theory, the inability to be applied in conjunction with complex experimental designs, difficulties with determining statistical confidence in inferred differences and an inherently pair-wise focus. Here, we present a cohesive and general analytical framework for the comparative analysis of G that addresses these issues, and that incorporates and extends current methods with a strong geometrical basis. We describe the application of random skewers, common subspace analysis, the 4th-order genetic covariance tensor and the decomposition of the multivariate breeders equation, all within a Bayesian framework. We illustrate these methods using data from an artificial selection experiment on eight traits in Drosophila serrata, where a multi-generational pedigree was available to estimate G in each of six populations. One method, the tensor, elegantly captures all of the variation in genetic variance among populations, and allows the identification of the trait combinations that differ most in genetic variance. The tensor approach is likely to be the most generally

Evolution kinetics were independent of the frequency of spontaneous mutations that confer antibiotic resistance or antibiotic dose-response curves, and were only loosely correlated to maximal antibiotic concentrations. Instead, rapid evolution required unrealized mutations that could markedly decrease antibiotic susceptibility.

abstract = {Pleiotropic effects among quantitative characters are believed to be extensive and universal, although their actual amount and pattern remains to be determined. Theoretical studies have shown that pleiotropic effects can influence the dynamics of a character under stabilizing selection and mutation through genetic correlations as well as hidden pleiotropic effects. It is further known that pleiotropic effects on fitness can cause an apparent stabilizing selection for an otherwise neutral character. The response to directional selection also depends on genetic correlations to other characters via correlated selection responses and deleterious side effects. In this paper we analyze a class of models for the adaptation of complex organisms based on three assumptions: (1) pleiotropic effects among characters are extensive, even in the absence of genetic correlations (hidden pleiotropic effects); (2) directional selection only acts on one or a small number of characters simultaneously (mosaic evolution); (3) the remaining characters are either neutral or under stabilizing selection. We show that the response to directed natural selection is strongly influenced by hidden pleiotropic effects on a second uncorrelated character which is under stabilizing selection. The hidden pleiotropic effects are inducing apparent stabilizing selection which interacts with the directional selection acting on the first character. The apparent stabilizing selection is mediated through the dynamics of the genetic variance associated with a change in the mean genotypic value. The result can be either inhibitory or accelerating, depending on the frequency of the alleles. The inhibitory effect can even completely prevent a response to directional selection if apparent stabilizing selection is strong compared to directional selection. In finite populations, the asymptotic rate of evolution is also influenced by hidden pleiotropic effects. This is mostly caused by a reduction of the asymptotic genetic variance maintained by mutation under sustained directional selection. It is concluded that hidden pleiotropic effects lead to adaptive inertia even in the absence of genetic correlations.},

Here we measure the effect of genetic drift on the shape of the G matrix using a large data set on the inheritance of wing characteristics in Drosophila melanogaster. Fifty-two inbred lines with a total of 4680 parent-offspring families were generated by one generation of brother-sister mating and compared to an outbred control population of 1945 families. In keeping with the theoretical expectation for a correlated set of additively determined traits, the average G matrix of the inbred lines remained proportional to the outbred control G matrix with a proportionality constant approximately equal to (1 {\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}} F), where F is the inbreeding coefficient. Further, the pattern of covariance among the means of the inbred lines induced by inbreeding was also proportional to the within-line G matrix of the control population with a constant very close to the expectation of 2F. Although the average G of the inbred lines did not show change in overall structure relative to the outbred controls, separate analysis revealed a great deal of variation among inbred lines around this expectation, including changes in the sign of genetic correlations. Since any given line can be quite different from the outbred control, it is likely that in nature unreplicated drift will lead to changes in the G matrix. Thus, the shape of G is malleable under genetic drift, and the evolutionary response of any particular population is likely to depend on the specifics of its evolutionary history.},

Here, we explore how these evolutionary dynamics are mirrored in multilocus linkage disequilibrium (MLD), a measure of multi-way associations between alleles. In the parameter regime corresponding to HIV, we show that deterministic early infection models induce MLD to oscillate over time in a wavelet-like fashion. We find that the frequency of these oscillations is proportional to the rate of adaptation. This signature is robust to drift, but can be eroded by high variation in fitness effects of beneficial mutations. Our findings suggest that MLD oscillations could be used as a signature of interference among multiple equally advantageous mutations and may aid the interpretation of MLD in data.},

We generated 20 replicate lineages allowed to fix a single mutation from each of four bacteriophage genotypes under identical selective regimes to test for parallel changes within and across genotypes at the levels of mutational effect distributions and gene, protein, amino acid, and nucleotide changes. All four genotypes shared a distribution of beneficial mutational effects best approximated by a distribution with a finite upper bound. Parallel adaptation was high at the protein, gene, amino acid, and nucleotide levels, both within and among phage genotypes, with the most common first-step mutation in each background fixing on an average in 7 of 20 replicates and half of the substitutions in two of the four genotypes occurring at shared sites. Remarkably, the mutation of largest beneficial effect that fixed for each genotype was never the most common, as would be expected if parallelism were driven by selection. In fact, the mutation of smallest benefit for each genotype fixed in a total of 7 of 80 lineages, equally as often as the mutation of largest benefit, leading us to conclude that adaptation was largely mutation-driven, such that mutational biases led to frequent parallel fixation of mutations of suboptimal effect.},

The distribution of selection coefficients is modal and closely resembles the Weibull distribution. The average selection coefficient (2.1) and beneficial mutation rate (3.8{\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}}10-8) are high relative to previous studies, possibly because the ancestral population grows poorly in serine-limited medium.

Newer models allow for the possibility that beneficial mutations are sufficiently common to coexist and compete for fixation within populations. Experimental evolution studies in microbes provide empirical support for stochastic models in which both selection and mutation are strong effects and clones compete for fixation; however, the relative importance of competition among clones bearing mutations of different selective effects versus competition among clones bearing multiple mutations remains unresolved.

abstract = {The process of selection on a multivariate set of characters subject to functional constraints is considered from the points of view of both evolutionary optimization theory and quantitative genetics. Special attention is given to life-history characteristics. It is shown that, under suitable conditions (including weak selection), useful approximate formulas for the relations between the functional constraints and the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix can be derived. These can be used to show that the conditions for equilibrium under selection according to the two different approaches are approximately equivalent. Although large negative genetic correlations are to be expected between some pairs of life-history traits in populations at equilibrium under selection, in general some small negative genetic correlations and some positive genetic correlations will also be present. Thus, the observation of a positive genetic correlation between a pair of life-history traits does not necessarily refute the possibility of trade-offs among a multivariate set of traits that contains the pair in question. The relation between the pattern of functional constraints and the genetic correlations is often complex, and little insight into the former can be derived from the latter. The effects of mutations that lower the overall efficiency of resource utilization, thereby creating a positive component to the genetic covariances among life-history traits, are also considered for a specific model. Although such mutations can have a substantial effect on the form of the life history, extreme conditions seem to be needed for them to produce a large effect on the pattern of genetic correlations in a random-mating population. They can, however, cause the appearance of positive correlations following inbreeding, due to the exposure of deleterious recessive or partially recessive mutations. The analysis also suggests that the population means of individual components of a constrained multivariate system may often equilibrate at values that are far from the optima that would be attained if they were selected in isolation from the other members of the system.},

The area traits correspond to the skeletal derivatives of mesenchymal condensations involved in the production of the rodent mandible. Three major questions are addressed. (1) Can differences in the form of the adult rodent mandible be explained by changes in specific morphogenetic components?F To answer this question, four specific hypotheses that might account for differences between mice and rats in morphological form of the mandible were evaluated: isometric size-scaling, mesenchymal condensation differentiation, muscle hypertrophy, and differential tooth growth. The results support all hypotheses except differential tooth growth, suggesting a complex and multidimensional differentiation in mandibular form between these taxa. The FESA and statistical analyses give qualitatively the same results for all of the hypotheses tested. (2) Has morphological change in mandible form been accompanied by significant changes in the genetic correlation structure?F Genetic correlation patterns among traits are different between these species, and these differences persist after the genetic correlation between mandible dimensions and body weight is accounted for. This result differs from those of previous reports on pelvic dimensions in these animals, where no significant change in genetic correlation structures was found, suggesting mosaic evolution of the skeletal system in these taxa. (3) Does using different extrinsic and intrinsic covariates to scale animals to the same size produce equivalent effects on the covariance structure of the traits?F Results show that different extrinsic and intrinsic covariates in analysis of covariance often produce very different results.},

abstract = {Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population genetics processes-notably, by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around s = 10{\^{}}-3.},

Although recent experiments demonstrate a central role for herbivory in driving rapid evolution of defense and competition-mediating traits, whether and how herbivory shapes heritable variation in these traits remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the structure and evolutionary stability of the G matrix for plant metabolites that are involved in defense and allelopathy in the tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima. We show that G has evolutionarily diverged between experimentally replicated populations that evolved in the presence versus the absence of ambient herbivory, providing direct evidence for the evolution of G by natural selection. Specifically, evolution in an herbivore-free habitat altered the orientation of G, revealing a negative genetic covariation between defense- and competition-related metabolites that is typically masked in herbivore-exposed populations. Our results may be explained by predictions of classical quantitative genetic theory, as well as the theory of acquisition-allocation trade-offs. The study provides compelling evidence that herbivory drives the evolution of plant genetic architecture.},

@article{Jones2007,
abstract = {Evolvability is a key characteristic of any evolving system, and the concept of evolvability serves as a unifying theme in a wide range of disciplines related to evolutionary theory. The field of quantitative genetics provides a framework for the exploration of evolvability with the promise to produce insights of global importance. With respect to the quantitative genetics of biological systems, the parameters most relevant to evolvability are the G-matrix, which describes the standing additive genetic variances and covariances for a suite of traits, and the M-matrix, which describes the effects of new mutations on genetic variances and covariances. A population's immediate response to selection is governed by the G-matrix. However, evolvability is also concerned with the ability of mutational processes to produce adaptive variants, and consequently the M-matrix is a crucial quantitative genetic parameter. Here, we explore the evolution of evolvability by using analytical theory and simulation-based models to examine the evolution of the mutational correlation, r{\_}mu, the key parameter determining the nature of genetic constraints imposed by M. The model uses a diploid, sexually reproducing population of finite size experiencing stabilizing selection on a two-trait phenotype. We assume that the mutational correlation is a third quantitative trait determined by multiple additive loci. An individual's value of the mutational correlation trait determines the correlation between pleiotropic effects of new alleles when they arise in that individual. Our results show that the mutational correlation, despite the fact that it is not involved directly in the specification of an individual's fitness, does evolve in response to selection on the bivariate phenotype. The mutational variance exhibits a weak tendency to evolve to produce alignment of the M-matrix with the adaptive landscape, but is prone to erratic fluctuations as a consequence of genetic drift. The interpretation of this result is that the evolvability of the population is capable of a response to selection, and whether this response results in an increase or decrease in evolvability depends on the way in which the bivariate phenotypic optimum is expected to move. Interestingly, both analytical and simulation results show that the mutational correlation experiences disruptive selection, with local fitness maxima at -1 and +1. Genetic drift counteracts the tendency for the mutational correlation to persist at these extreme values, however. Our results also show that an evolving M-matrix tends to increase stability of the G-matrix under most circumstances. Previous studies of G-matrix stability, which assume nonevolving M-matrices, consequently may overestimate the level of instability of G relative to what might be expected in natural systems. Overall, our results indicate that evolvability can evolve in natural systems in a way that tends to result in alignment of the G-matrix, the M-matrix, and the adaptive landscape, and that such evolution tends to stabilize the G-matrix over evolutionary time.},

The results from this analysis can be used to visualize the surface implied by a set of selection coefficients. Such a visualization provides a compact summary of selection coefficients, can aid in the comparison of selection surfaces, and can help generate testable hypotheses as to the adaptive significance of the traits under study. Further, we discuss traditional definitions of directional, stabilizing, and disruptive selection and conclude that selection may be more usefully classified into two general modes, directional and nonlinear selection, with stabilizing and disruptive selection as special cases of nonlinear selection.},

abstract = {Abstract Larger populations generally adapt faster to their existing environment. However, it is unknown if the population size experienced during evolution influences the ability to face sudden environmental changes. To investigate this issue, we subjected replicate Escherichia coli populations of different sizes to experimental evolution in an environment containing a cocktail of three antibiotics. In this environment, the ability to actively efflux molecules outside the cell is expected to be a major fitness-affecting trait. We found that all the populations eventually reached similar fitness in the antibiotic cocktail despite adapting at different speeds, with the larger populations adapting faster. Surprisingly, although efflux activity (EA) enhanced in the smaller populations, it decayed in the larger ones. The evolution of EA was largely shaped by pleiotropic responses to selection and not by drift. This demonstrates that quantitative differences in population size can lead to qualitative differences (decay/enhancement) in the fate of a character during adaptation to identical environments. Furthermore, the larger populations showed inferior fitness upon sudden exposure to several alternative stressful environments. These observations provide a novel link between population size and vulnerability to environmental changes. Counterintuitively, adapting in larger numbers can render bacterial populations more vulnerable to abrupt environmental changes.},

This is done by means of simple quantitative genetic models, which if anything underestimate the importance of constraints. The results show that even in the simplest case the response to selection will not generally be in the same direction as the selection vector, i.e. the direction to the nearest optimum. Adding complexity identifies cases where selection may lead the population in suboptimal directions. It is concluded that information about univariate genetic variances is not sufficient to predict evolutionary responses and may even be misleading. However, genetic covariances are not always acting as constraints, but can under certain circumstances promote evolution towards the nearest optimum. This can be understood by a spectral decomposition of the genetic variance-covariance matrix, where it is shown that the eigenvector associated with the largest amount of variance will to various degrees determine the outcome of selection. A literature survey of the pattern of character covariation in morphological characters in natural populations shows a wide variety of correlation patterns, but quite often shows a high level of covariance between traits. This suggests that constraints to short-term evolution may be more common than generally appreciated.},

  abstract  = {Transition bias, an overabundance of transitions relative to transversions, has been widely reported among studies of the rates and spectra of spontaneous mutations. However, demonstrating the role of transition bias in adaptive evolution remains challenging. In particular, it is unclear whether such biases direct the evolution of bacterial pathogens adapting to treatment. We addressed this challenge by analyzing adaptive  antibiotic-resistance mutations in the major human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). We found strong evidence for transition bias in two independently curated data sets comprising 152 and 208 antibiotic-resistance mutations. This was true at the level of mutational paths (distinct adaptive DNA sequence changes) and events (individual instances of the adaptive DNA sequence changes) and across different genes and gene promoters conferring resistance to a diversity of antibiotics. It was also true for mutations that do not code for amino acid changes (in gene promoters and the 16S ribosomal RNA gene rrs) and for mutations that are synonymous to each other and are therefore likely to have similar fitness effects, suggesting that transition bias can be caused by a bias in mutation supply. These results point to a central role for transition bias in determining which mutations drive adaptive antibiotic resistance evolution in a key pathogen.},

@article{haller2014solving,
abstract = {Despite the potential for rapid evolution, stasis is commonly observed over geological timescales-the so-called ``paradox of stasis.'' This paradox would be resolved if stabilizing selection were common, but stabilizing selection is infrequently detected in natural populations. We hypothesize a simple solution to this apparent disconnect: stabilizing selection is hard to detect empirically once populations have adapted to a fitness peak. To test this hypothesis, we developed an individual-based model of a population evolving under an invariant stabilizing fitness function. Stabilizing selection on the population was infrequently detected in an ``empirical'' sampling protocol, because (1) trait variation was low relative to the fitness peak breadth; (2) nonselective deaths masked selection; (3) populations wandered around the fitness peak; and (4) sample sizes were typically too small. Moreover, the addition of negative frequency-dependent selection further hindered detection by flattening or even dimpling the fitness peak, a phenomenon we term ``squashed stabilizing selection.'' Our model demonstrates that stabilizing selection provides a plausible resolution to the paradox of stasis despite its infrequent detection in nature. The key reason is that selection ``erases its traces'': once populations have adapted to a fitness peak, they are no longer expected to exhibit detectable stabilizing selection. },

abstract = {Reproduction shortens lifespan in practically all organisms examined so far, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown to date. Here I review what evolutionary and molecular biologists have learned about such "costs of reproduction" in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) since Maynard Smith's (1958) seminal discovery that sterile mutants in D. subobscura live substantially longer than fertile wildtype flies. Together with observations from the nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and other organisms, the data from Drosophila suggest that there are at least four general principles that underlie trade-offs between reproduction and lifespan: (1) trade-offs between survival and reproduction are widespread; (2) the relationship between increased lifespan and decreased fecundity can be uncoupled under certain conditions; (3) while survival costs of reproduction might not necessarily be due to competitive resource allocation, we lack robust alternative explanations for their occurrence; and (4) physiological trade-offs between reproduction and longevity do not always translate into evolutionary genetic trade-offs. I conclude that - despite much recent progress - our current understanding of the proximate basis of survival costs of reproduction remains very limited; much future work on the genetics and physiology of such trade-offs will be required to uncover their mechanistic basis.},

We observed intermediate to high levels of broad- and narrow-sense heritabilities for all traits, but genetic variation was consistently lower in the selfing species.

abstract = {Are measurements of quantitative genetic variation useful for predicting long-term adaptive evolution? To answer this question, I focus on gmax, the multivariate direction of greatest additive genetic variance within populations. Original data on threespine sticklebacks, together with published genetic measurements from other vertebrates, show that morphological differentiation between species has been biased in the direction of gmax for at least four million years, despite evidence that natural selection is the cause of differentiation. This bias toward the direction of evolution tends to decay with time. Rate of morphological divergence between species is inversely proportional to theta??, the angle between the direction of divergence and the direction of greatest genetic variation. The direction of greatest phenotypic variance is not identical with gmax, but for these data is nearly as successful at predicting the direction of species divergence. I interpret the findings to mean that genetic variances and covariances constrain adaptive change in quantitative traits for reasonably long spans of time. An alternative hypothesis, however, cannot be ruled out: that morphological differentiation is biased in the direction gmax because divergence and gmax are both shaped by the same natural selection pressures. Either way, the results reveal that adaptive differentiation occurs principally along ``genetic lines of least resistance.''},

@article{Kohn1988,
abstract = {An integral assumption of many models of morphometric evolution is the equality of the genetic variance-covariance structure across evolutionary time. To examine this assumption, the quantitative-genetic aspects of morphometric form are examined for eight pelvic traits in laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus) and random-bred ICR mice (Mus musculus). In both species, all traits are significantly heritable, and there are significant phenotypic and genetic correlations among traits, although environmental correlations among the eight traits are low. The size relations among the pelvic variables are isometric. Three matrix-permutation tests are used to examine similarity of phenotypic, genetic, and environmental covariance and correlation matrices within and between species. Independent patterns of morphometric covariation and correlation arise from genetic and environmental effects within each species and from environmental effects between species. The patterns of phenotypic and genetic covariation and correlation are similar within each species, and the phenotypic and genetic correlations are also similar between these species. However, genetic covariance matrices show no significant statistical association between species. It is suggested that the assumption of equality of genetic variance-covariance structures across divergent taxa should be approached with caution.},

abstract = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious mutations.},

A new formula for the expected equilibrium variance is derived that approximates the observed equilibrium variance very closely for all parameter combinations we have tested. The computer model simulates the continuum-of-alleles model of Crow and Kimura. However, it is completely stochastic in the sense that it models evolution as a Markov process and does not use any deterministic evolution equations. The theoretical results are compared with heritability estimates from laboratory and natural populations. Heritabilities ranging from 20{\%} to 50{\%}, as observed even in lab populations under a constant environment, can only be explained by a mutation-selection balance if the phenotypic character is neutral or the number of genes contributing to the trait is sufficiently high, typically several hundred, or if there are a few highly variable loci that influence quantitative traits.},

abstract = {Trade-offs are a core component of many evolutionary models, particularly those dealing with the evolution of life histories. In the present paper, we identify four topics of key importance for studies of the evolutionary biology of trade-offs. First, we consider the underlying concept of constraint'. We conclude that this term is typically used too vaguely and suggest that constraint' in the sense of a bias should be clearly distinguished from constraint' in the sense of proscribed combinations of traits or evolutionary trajectories. Secondly, we address the utility of the acquisition-allocation model (the Y-model'). We find that, whereas this model and its derivatives have provided new insights, a misunderstanding of the pivotal equation has led to incorrect predictions and faulty tests. Thirdly, we ask how trade-offs are expected to evolve under directional selection. A quantitative genetic model predicts that, under weak or short-term selection, the intercept will change but the slope will remain constant. Two empirical tests support this prediction but these are based on comparisons of geographic populations: more direct tests will come from artificial selection experiments. Finally, we discuss what maintains variation in trade-offs noting that at present little attention has been given to this question. We distinguish between phenotypic and genetic variation and suggest that the latter is most in need of explanation. We suggest that four factors deserving investigation are mutation-selection balance, antagonistic pleiotropy, correlational selection and spatio-temporal variation, but as in the other areas of research on trade-offs, empirical generalizations are impeded by lack of data. Although this lack is discouraging, we suggest that it provides a rich ground for further study and the integration of many disciplines, including the emerging field of genomics.},

abstract = {Summary
In February, 2016, WHO released a report for the development of national action plans to address the threat of antibiotic resistance, the catastrophic consequences of inaction, and the need for antibiotic stewardship. Antibiotic stewardship combined with infection prevention comprises a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to optimise use of antibiotics. Efforts to mitigate overuse will be unsustainable without learning and coordinating activities globally. In this Personal View, we provide examples of international collaborations to address optimal prescribing, focusing on five countries that have developed different approaches to antibiotic stewardship-the USA, South Africa, Colombia, Australia, and the UK. Although each country's approach differed, when nurtured, individual efforts can positively affect local and national antimicrobial stewardship programmes. Government advocacy, national guidelines, collaborative research, online training programmes, mentoring programmes, and social media in stewardship all played a role. Personal relationships and willingness to learn from each other's successes and failures continues to foster collaboration. We recommend that antibiotic stewardship models need to evolve from infection specialist-based teams to develop and use cadres of health-care professionals, including pharmacists, nurses, and community health workers, to meet the needs of the global population. We also recommend that all health-care providers who prescribe antibiotics take ownership and understand the societal burden of suboptimal antibiotic use, providing examples of how countries can learn, act globally, and share best antibiotic stewardship practices.},

abstract = {Within a given gene, there may be many possible mutations that are capable of producing a particular change in phenotype. However, if some sites have especially high rates of mutation to function-altering alleles, then such mutations may make disproportionate contributions to phenotypic evolution. We report the discovery that a point mutation at a highly mutable site in the $\beta$-globin gene of Andean house wrens has produced a physiologically important change in the oxygenation properties of hemoglobin (Hb). The mutant allele that confers an increased HbâO2 affinity is present at an unusually high frequency at high altitude. These findings suggest that site-specific variation in mutation rate may exert a strong influence on the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution.A key question in evolutionary genetics is why certain mutations or certain types of mutation make disproportionate contributions to adaptive phenotypic evolution. In principle, the preferential fixation of particular mutations could stem directly from variation in the underlying rate of mutation to function-altering alleles. However, the influence of mutation bias on the genetic architecture of phenotypic evolution is difficult to evaluate because data on rates of mutation to function-altering alleles are seldom available. Here, we report the discovery that a single point mutation at a highly mutable site in the $\beta$A-globin gene has contributed to an evolutionary change in hemoglobin (Hb) function in high-altitude Andean house wrens (Troglodytes aedon). Results of experiments on native Hb variants and engineered, recombinant Hb mutants demonstrate that a nonsynonymous mutation at a CpG dinucleotide in the $\beta$A-globin gene is responsible for an evolved difference in HbâO2 affinity between high- and low-altitude house wren populations. Moreover, patterns of genomic differentiation between high- and low-altitude populations suggest that altitudinal differentiation in allele frequencies at the causal amino acid polymorphism reflects a history of spatially varying selection. The experimental results highlight the influence of mutation rate on the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution by demonstrating that a large-effect allele at a highly mutable CpG site has promoted physiological differentiation in blood O2 transport capacity between house wren populations that are native to different elevations.},

abstract = {Like allozyme variation, heritable variation for polygenic traits is maintained by unknown processes. In an influential paper that combined mathematical analysis with a review of relevant data, Lande (1975) proposed that high levels of variation could be maintained by mutation in the face of stabilizing selection. In addition to presenting an appealing hypothesis for the persistence of heritable variation, Lande's paper spawned a new industry of mathematical analyses for the genetic dynamics of polygenic traits. These analyses are based on a model that assumes only additive allelic effects and a continuum of alleles at each locus. In addition, the analyses assume that at each locus the distribution of allelic effects segregating in a population is approximately Gaussian. The mathematical tractability of the resulting Gaussian genetic model permits analytical treatment of formidable multilocus problems. Despite its widespread use, relatively little attention has been devoted to the biological and mathematical assumptions underlying this model. Using both mathematical and empirical evidence, I demonstrate that the Gaussian genetic model relies on the unsubstantiated assumption that per locus mutation rates typically exceed 10{\^{}}-4. I present alternative (non-Gaussian) approximations that apply for lower per locus mutation rates and compare the resulting predictions to those obtained from Gaussian analyses. The primary conclusion is that qualitatively different predictions can arise from conventional analyses that derive rather than assume the distribution of allele effects. In particular, I argue that it will be very difficult to test the hypothesis that significant levels of heritable variation are maintained by mutation-selection balance.},

@article{desai2007beneficial,
abstract = {When beneficial mutations are rare, they accumulate by a series of selective sweeps. But when they are common, many beneficial mutations will occur before any can fix, so there will be many different mutant lineages in the population concurrently. In an asexual population, these different mutant lineages interfere and not all can fix simultaneously. In addition, further beneficial mutations can accumulate in mutant lineages while these are still a minority of the population. In this article, we analyze the dynamics of such multiple mutations and the interplay between multiple mutations and interference between clones. These result in substantial variation in fitness accumulating within a single asexual population. The amount of variation is determined by a balance between selection, which destroys variation, and beneficial mutations, which create more. The behavior depends in a subtle way on the population parameters: the population size, the beneficial mutation rate, and the distribution of the fitness increments of the potential beneficial mutations. The mutation-selection balance leads to a continually evolving population with a steady-state fitness variation. This variation increases logarithmically with both population size and mutation rate and sets the rate at which the population accumulates beneficial mutations, which thus also grows only logarithmically with population size and mutation rate. These results imply that mutator phenotypes are less effective in larger asexual populations. They also have consequences for the advantages (or disadvantages) of sex via the Fisher-Muller effect; these are discussed briefly.},

@article{Ternent2015,
abstract = {Abstract Bacterial resistance to antibiotic treatment is a huge concern: introduction of any new antibiotic is shortly followed by the emergence of resistant bacterial isolates in the clinic. This issue is compounded by a severe lack of new antibiotics reaching the market. The significant rise in clinical resistance to antibiotics is especially problematic in nosocomial infections, where already vulnerable patients may fail to respond to treatment, causing even greater health concern. A recent focus has been on the development of anti-virulence drugs as a second line of defence in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections. This treatment, which weakens bacteria by reducing their virulence rather than killing them, should allow infections to be cleared through the body?s natural defence mechanisms. In this way there should be little to no selective pressure exerted on the organism and, as such, a predominantly resistant population should be less likely to emerge. However, before the likelihood of resistance to these novel drugs emerging can be predicted, we must first establish whether such drugs can actually be effective. Many believe that anti-virulence drugs would not be powerful enough to clear existing infections, restricting their potential application to prophylaxis. We have developed a mathematical model that provides a theoretical framework to reveal the circumstances under which anti-virulence drugs may or may not be successful. We demonstrate that by harnessing and combining the advantages of antibiotics with those provided by anti-virulence drugs, given infection-specific parameters, it is possible to identify treatment strategies that would efficiently clear bacterial infections, while preventing the emergence of antibiotic-resistant subpopulations. Our findings strongly support the continuation of research into anti-virulence drugs and demonstrate that their applicability may reach beyond infection prevention.},

Recently, critics of standard evolutionary theory have questioned the random and non-directional nature of mutations, claiming that the mutational process can be adaptive in its own right.

Both prospective and retrospective studies of phenotypic evolution across generations rely on assumptions about the constancy of patterns of genetic covariance through time. In the absence of robust theoretical predictions about the stability of genetic covariances, this assumption must be tested with empirical comparisons of genetic parameters among populations and species. Genetic variance-covariance matrices were estimated for a suite of antipredator traits in two populations of the northwestern garter snake, Thamnophis ordinoides. The characters studied include color pattern and antipredator behaviors that interact to facilitate escape from predators. Significant heritabilities for all traits were detected in both populations. Genetic correlations and covariances were found among behaviors in both populations and between color pattern and behavior in one of the populations. Phenotypic means differed among populations, but pairwise comparisons revealed no heterogeneity of genetic parameters between the populations. The structure of the genetic variance-covariance matrix has apparently not changed significantly during the divergence of these two populations.},

Even though many drug resistances confer a fitness cost, suggesting that they might disappear by reducing the volume of antibiotic use, increasing evidence obtained from laboratory and epidemiological studies indicate that several processes will act to cause long-term persistence of resistant bacteria. Compensatory evolution that ameliorates the costs of resistance, the occurrence of cost-free resistances and genetic linkage between non-selected and selected resistances will confer a stabilization of the resistant bacteria. Thus, it is of importance that we forcefully implement strategies to reduce the rate of appearance and spread of resistant bacteria to allow new drug discovery to catch up with bacterial resistance development.},

abstract = {Pleiotropy is the property of genes affecting multiple functions or characters of an organism. Genes vary widely in their degree of pleiotropy, but this variation is often considered a by-product of their evolutionary history. We present a functional theory of how pleiotropy may itself evolve. We consider genes that contribute to two functions, where contributing more to one function detracts from allocation to the second function. We show that whether genes become pleiotropic or specialize on a single function depends on the nature of trade-offs as gene activities contribute to different traits and on how the functionality of these traits affects fitness. In general, when a gene product can perform well at two functions, it evolves to do so, but not when pleiotropy would greatly disrupt each function. Consequently, reduced pleiotropy should often evolve, with genes specializing on the trait that is currently more important to fitness. Even when pleiotropy does evolve, not all genes are expected to become equally pleiotropic; genes with higher levels of expression are more likely to evolve greater pleiotropy. For the case of gene duplicates, we find that perfect subfunctionalization evolves only under stringent conditions. More often, duplicates are expected to maintain a certain degree of functional redundancy, with the gene contributing more to trait functionality evolving the highest degree of pleiotropy. Gene product interactions can facilitate subfunctionalization, but whether they do so depends on the curvature of the fitness surface. Finally, we find that stochastic gene expression favors pleiotropy by selecting for robustness in fitness components.},

This doctrine rests on the theoretical claim that because mutation rates are small in comparison to selection coefficients, mutation is powerless to overcome opposing selection. Using a simple population-genetic model, this claim is shown to depend on assuming the prior availability of variation, so that mutation may act only as a ``pressure'' on the frequencies of existing alleles, and not as the evolutionary process that introduces novelty. As shown here, mutational bias in the introduction of novelty can strongly influence the course of evolution, even when mutation rates are small in comparison to selection coefficients. Recognizing this mode of causation provides a distinct mechanistic basis for an ``internalis'' approach to determining the contribution of mutational and developmental factors to evolutionary phenomena such as homoplasy, parallelism, and directionality.},

Recent analytical and computational advances have improved both the power and the accessibility of the necessary multivariate statistics. It is now possible to study the relationships between G and other evolutionary parameters, such as those describing the mutational input, the shape and orientation of the adaptive landscape, and the phenotypic divergence among populations. At the same time, we are moving towards a greater understanding of how the genetic variation summarized by G evolves. Computer simulations of the evolution of G, innovations in matrix comparison methods, and rapid development of powerful molecular genetic tools have all opened the way for dissecting the interaction between allelic variation and evolutionary process.

abstract = {A new and more robust evolutionary synthesis is emerging that attempts to explain macroevolution as well as microevolutionary events. This new synthesis emphasizes three morphological areas of biology that had been marginalized by the Modern Synthesis of genetics and evolution: embryology, macroevolution, and homology. The foundations for this new synthesis have been provided by new findings from developmental genetics and from the reinterpretation of the fossil record. In this nascent synthesis, macroevolutionary questions are not seen as being soluble by population genetics, and the developmental actions of genes involved with growth and cell specification are seen as being critical for the formation of higher taxa. In addition to discovering the remarkable homologies of homeobox genes and their domains of expression, developmental genetics has recently proposed homologies of process that supplement the older homologies of structure. Homologous developmental pathways, such those involving thewntgenes, are seen in numerous embryonic processes, and they are seen occurring in discrete regions, the morphogenetic fields. These fields (which exemplify the modular nature of developing embryos) are proposed to mediate between genotype and phenotype. Just as the cell (and not its genome) functions as the unit of organic structure and function, so the morphogenetic field (and not the genes or the cells) is seen as a major unit of ontogeny whose changes bring about changes in evolution.},

Most analyses of these distortions focus on the signatures of hitchhiking due to hard or soft selective sweeps at a single genetic locus. However, in linked regions of rapidly adapting genomes, multiple beneficial mutations at different loci can segregate simultaneously within the population, an effect known as clonal interference. This leads to a subtle interplay between hitchhiking and interference effects, which leads to a unique signature of rapid adaptation on genetic variation both at the selected sites and at linked neutral loci. Here, we introduce an effective coalescent theory (a {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}fitness-class coalescent{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}}) that describes how positive selection at many perfectly linked sites alters the structure of genealogies. We use this theory to calculate several simple statistics describing genetic variation within a rapidly adapting population and to implement efficient backward-time coalescent simulations, which can be used to predict how clonal interference alters the expected patterns of molecular evolution.},

To observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor the relative frequencies of [sim]500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic effects become important.},

Interestingly, mutator bacteria elevate only specific types of mutations, and therefore could be very sensitive to genetic constraints. Testing this possibility is not only clinically relevant, but can also inform about the general impact of genetic constraints in adaptation. Here, we evolved 576 populations of two mutator and one wild-type Escherichia coli to doubling concentrations of the antibiotic cefotaxime. All strains carried TEM-1, a $\beta$-lactamase enzyme well known by its low availability of mutational pathways. Crucially, one of the mutators does not elevate any of the relevant first-step mutations known to improve cefatoximase activity. Despite this, both mutators displayed a similar ability to evolve more than 1000-fold resistance. Initial adaptation proceeded in parallel through general multi-drug resistance mechanisms. High-level resistance, in contrast, was achieved through divergent paths; with the a priori inferior mutator exploiting alternative mutational pathways in PBP3, the target of the antibiotic. These results have implications for mutator management in clinical infections and, more generally, illustrate that limits to natural selection in real organisms are alleviated by the existence of multiple loci contributing to fitness.},

abstract = {Recent calls for a revision of standard evolutionary theory (SET) are based partly on arguments about the reciprocal causation. Reciprocal causation means that causeâeffect relationships are bi-directional, as a cause could later become an effect and vice versa. Such dynamic cause-effect relationships raise questions about the distinction between proximate and ultimate causes, as originally formulated by Ernst Mayr. They have also motivated some biologists and philosophers to argue for an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES). The EES will supposedly expand the scope of the Modern Synthesis (MS) and SET, which has been characterized as gene-centred, relying primarily on natural selection and largely neglecting reciprocal causation. Here, I critically examine these claims, with a special focus on the last conjecture. I conclude that reciprocal causation has long been recognized as important by naturalists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists working in the in the MS tradition, although it it could be explored even further. Numerous empirical examples of reciprocal causation in the form of positive and negative feedback are now well known from both natural and laboratory systems. Reciprocal causation have also been explicitly incorporated in mathematical models of coevolutionary arms races, frequency-dependent selection, eco-evolutionary dynamics and sexual selection. Such dynamic feedback were already recognized by Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin in their bok The Dialectical Biologist. Reciprocal causation and dynamic feedback might also be one of the few contributions of dialectical thinking and Marxist philosophy in evolutionary theory. I discuss some promising empirical and analytical tools to study reciprocal causation and the implications for the EES. Finally, I briefly discuss how quantitative genetics can be adapated to studies of reciprocal causation, constructive inheritance and phenotypic plasticity and suggest that the flexibility of this approach might have been underestimated by critics of contemporary evolutionary biology.},

Beneficial mutations appear at rate U and their selective effects s are drawn from a distribution g(s). After introducing the required models and concepts of mathematical population genetics, we review different approaches to computing the speed of logarithmic fitness increase as a function of N, U and g(s).

We then discuss approximate approaches to the finite population problem, distinguishing between the case of a single selection coefficient, g(s)=detla(s-s{\_}b), and a continuous distribution of selection coefficients.

In this paper we examine the stability of the genetic architecture of two traits known to be subject to natural selection; femur length and ovipositor length in two species of the cricket Allonemobius. Previous studies have shown that in A. fasciatus and A. socius natural selection favours an increased body size southwards but a decreased ovipositor length. Such countergradient selection should tend to favour a change in G. In the total sample of eight populations of A. socius and one of A. fasciatus we show that there is significant variation in all genetic covariance components, i.e. VA for body size, VA for ovipositor length, and CovA. This variation results entirely from an increase in the covariances of A. fasciatus. However, although larger, these components are approximately proportionally increased, thereby leading to no statistically significant change in the genetic correlation. A proportional increase in the covariance components is consistent with changes resulting from genetic drift. On the other hand, the genetic covariance components are significantly correlated with the length of the growing season suggesting that the change in the genetic architecture is the result of selection and drift.},

While the hindering effect of strongly deleterious mutations on adaptive evolution has been well studied, how weakly deleterious mutations, either in isolation or with superior beneficial mutations, influence the rate of adaptation has not been fully explored. When the selection against the deleterious mutations is weak, the beneficial mutant can fix in many genetic backgrounds, besides the one it arose on. Here, taking this factor into account, I obtain an accurate analytical expression for the fixation probability of a beneficial mutant in an asexual population at mutation-selection balance. I then exploit this result along with clonal interference theory to investigate the joint effect of linked beneficial and deleterious mutations on the rate of adaptation, and identify parameter regions where it is reduced due to interference by either beneficial or deleterious or both types of mutations. I also study the evolution of mutation rates in adapting asexual populations, and find that linked beneficial mutations have a stronger influence than the deleterious mutations on mutator fixation.},

abstract = {The rapid emergence of bacterial strains resistant to multiple antibiotics is posing a growing public health risk. The mechanisms underlying the rapid evolution of drug resistance are, however, poorly understood. The heterogeneity of the environments in which bacteria encounter antibiotic drugs could play an important role. E.g., in the highly compartmentalized human body, drug levels can vary substantially between different organs and tissues. It has been proposed that this could facilitate the selection of resistant mutants, and recent experiments support this. To study the role of spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of drug resistance, we present a quantitative model describing an environment subdivided into relatively isolated compartments with various antibiotic concentrations, in which bacteria evolve under the stochastic processes of proliferation, migration, mutation and death. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that concentration gradients can foster a mode of adaptation that is impossible in uniform environments. It allows resistant mutants to evade competition and circumvent the slow process of fixation by invading compartments with higher drug concentrations, where less resistant strains cannot subsist. The speed of this process increases sharply with the sensitivity of the growth rate to the antibiotic concentration, which we argue to be generic. Comparable adaptation rates in uniform environments would require a high selection coefficient (s?{\textgreater}?0.1) for each forward mutation. Similar processes can occur if the heterogeneity is more complex than just a linear gradient. The model may also be applicable to other adaptive processes involving environmental heterogeneity and range expansion.},

The tempo and mode of adaptive evolution determine how natural selection shapes patterns of genetic diversity in DNA polymorphism data. While slow mutation-limited adaptation leads to classical footprints of âhard' selective sweeps, these patterns are different when adaptation responds quickly to a novel selection pressure, acting either on standing genetic variation or on recurrent new mutation. In the past decade, corresponding footprints of âsoft' selective sweeps have been described both in theoretical models and in empirical data. Here, we summarize the key theoretical concepts and contrast model predictions with observed patterns in Drosophila, humans, and microbes. Evi dence in all cases shows that âsoft' patterns of rapid adaptation are frequent. However, theory and data also point to a role of complex adaptive histories in rapid evolution. While existing theory allows for important implications on the tempo and mode of the adaptive process, complex footprints observed in data are, as yet, insufficiently covered by models.

abstract = {Models for the evolution of continuously varying traits use heritabilities, genetic correlations, and the G-matrix to quantify the genetic variation upon which selection acts. Given estimates of these parameters, it is possible to predict the long-term effects of selection, infer past selective forces responsible for observed differences between populations or species, and distinguish the effects of drift from selection. Application of these methods, however, requires the unproven assumption that the G-matrix remains constant from one generation to the next. This study examines the assumption of constancy for the wing pattern characteristics of two sibling species of butterflies, Precis coenia and P. evarete (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Quantitative genetic parameters were estimated from parent-offspring regression. Two approaches were taken to test the null hypothesis of equality between species. First, pairwise tests between corresponding elements of G and between heritabilities and genetic correlations for the two species were constructed. Second, a modification of Bartlett's modified likelihood-ratio test was used to test for equality between the G-matrices. The matrix test failed to detect any between species differences. In contrast, pairwise comparision revealed significant differences. Thus, it appears that constancy cannot be assumed at the species level in quantitative genetic studies. In particular, the assumption of constancy was violated for the trait with the greatest difference in mean phenotype.},

abstract = {The spatial range of a species habitat is generally determined by the ability of the species to cope with biotic and abiotic variables that vary in space. Therefore, the species range is itself an evolvable property. Indeed, environmental gradients permit a mode of evolution in which range expansion and adaptation go hand in hand. This process can contribute to rapid evolution of drug resistant bacteria and viruses, because drug concentrations in humans and livestock treated with antibiotics are far from uniform. Here, we use a minimal stochastic model of discrete, interacting organisms evolving in continuous space to study how the rate of adaptation of a quantitative trait depends on the steepness of the gradient and various population parameters. We discuss analytical results for the mean-field limit as well as extensive stochastic simulations. These simulations were performed using an exact, event-driven simulation scheme that can deal with continuous time-, density- and coordinate-dependent reaction rates and could be used for a wide variety of stochastic systems. The results reveal two qualitative regimes. If the gradient is shallow, the rate of adaptation is limited by dispersion and increases linearly with the gradient slope. If the gradient is steep, the adaptation rate is limited by mutation. In this regime, the mean-field result is highly misleading: it predicts that the adaptation rate continues to increase with the gradient slope, whereas stochastic simulations show that it in fact decreases with the square root of the slope. This discrepancy underscores the importance of discreteness and stochasticity even at high population densities; mean-field results, including those routinely used in quantitative genetics, should be interpreted with care.},

abstract = {Populations unable to evolve to selectively favored states are constrained. Genetic constraints occur when additive genetic variance in selectively favored directions is absent (absolute constraints) or present but small (quantitative constraints). Quantitative-unlike absolute-constraints are presumed surmountable given time. This ignores that a population might become extinct before reaching the favored state, in which case demography effectively converts a quantitative into an absolute constraint. Here, we derive criteria for predicting when such conversions occur. We model the demography and evolution of populations subject to optimizing selection that experience either a single shift or a constant change in the optimum. In the single-shift case, we consider whether a population can evolve significantly without declining or else declines temporarily while avoiding low sizes consistent with high extinction risk. We analyze when populations in constantly changing environments evolve sufficiently to ensure long-term growth. From these, we derive formulas for critical levels of genetic variability that define demography-caused absolute constraints. The formulas depend on estimable properties of fitness, population size, or environmental change rates. Each extends to selection on multivariate traits. Our criteria define the nearly null space of a population's G matrix, the set of multivariate directions effectively inaccessible to it via adaptive evolution.},

abstract = {Competition among individuals is central to our understanding of ecology and population dynamics. However, it could also have major implications for the evolution of resource-dependent life history traits (for example, growth, fecundity) that are important determinants of fitness in natural populations. This is because when competition occurs, the phenotype of each individual will be causally influenced by the phenotypes, and so the genotypes, of competitors. Theory tells us that indirect genetic effects arising from competitive interactions will give rise to the phenomenon of 'evolutionary environmental deterioration', and act as a source of evolutionary constraint on resource-dependent traits under natural selection. However, just how important this constraint is remains an unanswered question. This article seeks to stimulate empirical research in this area, first highlighting some patterns emerging from life history studies that are consistent with a competition-based model of evolutionary constraint, before describing several quantitative modelling strategies that could be usefully applied. A recurrent theme is that rigorous quantification of a competition's impact on life history evolution will require an understanding of the causal pathways and behavioural processes by which genetic (co)variance structures arise. Knowledge of the G-matrix among life history traits is not, in and of itself, sufficient to identify the constraints caused by competition. INTRODUCTION Classical quantitative genetic models tell us that a heritable pheno-typic trait under selection should evolve. In the simplest caseâwhere selection acts on a single trait onlyâthe change in phenotypic mean after one generation of selection (R) is predicted by the breeders equation (Lush, 1937) as the product of the narrow sense heritability (h 2) and a linear selection differential (S). Over the past two decades there has been tremendous interest in estimating these (and other) quantitative genetic parameters in wild-animal populations, as a step towards a better understanding of how phenotypes evolve under natural selection (Kingsolver et al., 2001; Ellegren and Sheldon, 2008; Kruuk et al., 2008). A pattern that has emerged from this work is that linear (directional) selection on traits is common (Kingsolver et al., 2001; Kingsolver and Diamond, 2011), while heritable variation for fitness-related traits is also widespread (Kruuk et al., 2008). Although it is important to acknowledge that the difficulty of accurately and precisely estimating selection and genetic variance in wild populations can be great (Stinchcombe et al., 2002; Kruuk and Hadfield, 2007; Hadfield, 2008; Morrissey et al., 2010), on taking parameter estimates at face value phenotypic stasis is commonly observed in situations where relatively rapid trait evolution is predicted (Meril{\"{a}} et al., 2001). This has given rise to the interest in the question of what constrains phenotypic evolution (Meril{\"{a}} et al., 2001; Kruuk et al., 2008; Blows and Walsh, 2009). That the univariate breeder's equation is not adequate for predict-ing phenotypic change in a natural population should not surprise us. It is only a complete description of phenotypic change under particular conditions (for example, a constant environment, negligible genetic drift and discrete generations) and makes assumptions that are probably untenable in any natural population (for example, that selection is not acting on traits genetically correlated with the character of interest). Nonetheless, it provides a useful yardstick against which to test biological hypotheses about the origin of evolutionary constraint in any given case (Morrissey et al., 2010). Here the term constraint will be used throughout to describe any process that reduces the rate of evolutionary change relative to naive expectations from the simple models. Fluctuating selection, maternal effects, interlocus conflict, G {\^{A}} E interactions and selection on genetically correlated traits are all potential sources of constraint that are being subjected to empirical scrutiny by evolutionary biologists and ecologists (Fairbairn and Roff, 2006; Wilson et al., 2006; Siepielski et al., 2009). However, one hypothesised source of constraint on phenotypic evolution that has received very limited empirical scrutiny to date is competition. Competition among individuals, which occurs when one or more resource (for example, food, territory, mating opportunities) is limiting, is central to our understanding of ecology and population dynamics. However, it also has major implications for the evolution of phenotypic traits both as a source of selection (for example, maleâ male competition selecting for weaponry traits) and because it can influence the genetic (co)variance structure of resource-dependent life history traits (for example, growth, maturation, fecundity). When competitive interactions occur, the expression of a resource-dependent phenotype, for example, growth, in any focal individual will depend on the extent to which its resource acquisition is decreased by its competitors. Under conditions of resource},

abstract = {Using a previously undescribed approach, we develop an analytic model that predicts whether an asexual population accumulates advantageous or deleterious mutations over time and the rate at which either process occurs. The model considers a large number of linked identical loci, or nucleotide sites; assumes that the selection coefficient per site is much less than the mutation rate per genome; and includes back and compensating mutations. Using analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our results over almost the entire range of population sizes. Two limiting cases of our results, when either deleterious or advantageous mutations can be neglected, correspond to the Fisher-Muller effect and Muller's ratchet, respectively. By comparing predictions of our model (no recombination) to those of simple single-locus models (strong recombination), we show that the accumulation of advantageous mutations is slowed by linkage over a broad, finite range of population size. This supports the view of Fisher and Muller, who argued in the 1930s that progressive evolution of organisms is slowed because loci at which beneficial mutations can occur are often linked together on the same chromosome. These results follow from our main finding, that distribution of sequences over the mutation number evolves as a traveling wave whose speed and width depend on population size and other parameters. The model explains a logarithmic dependence of steady-state fitness on the population size reported recently for an RNA virus.},

abstract = {Do size and phylogeny affect patterns of covariation in life-history traits? If there are phylogenetic constraints on the evolution of life histories, do they differ from lineage to lineage? I applied principal component analysis and cluster analysis to two data sets - 65 mammal species (14 orders, 30 families, 10 traits) and 162 mammal species (22 orders, 64 families, 6 traits). In both data sets, most of the covariation in life-history traits could be accounted for by the first two factors, and in both data sets their interpretation was similar. The first factor, accounting for 68-75{\%} of covariation of life-history traits, ranked the animals from early maturing, small, short-lived animals with short gestation periods, many small altricial young, and long lactation periods, to the opposite suite of traits in large animals. The second factor, accounting for 12-20{\%} of the covariation in life-history traits, ranked the animals from altricial to precocial. When order and family effects were removed, the proportion of variance accounted for by the first factor dropped 29-36{\%}, and the number of high-level clusters increased. Analysis within individual families revealed differences from lineage to lineage in the loadings of each trait on the first two principle factors. Weight alone accounts for much of the tendency for mammals to be arranged on a single axis ranging from early maturing, highly fecund, and short-lived small animals to the opposite. However, after the effects of weight were removed, order and family effects still had significant impact on patterns of covariation. Thus morphological design, in addition to size, may constrain life-history evolution. This explains why earlier workers saw clear patterns of covariation at high taxonomic levels whereas subsequent workers have found less covariation within species.},

abstract = {Slowing the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is essential if we are to continue to successfully treat infectious diseases. Whether a drug-resistant mutant grows to high densities, and so sickens the patient and spreads to new hosts, is determined by the competitive interactions it has with drug-susceptible pathogens within the host. Competitive interactions thus represent a good target for resistance management strategies. Using an in vivo model of malaria infection, we show that limiting a resource that is disproportionately required by resistant parasites retards the evolution of drug resistance by intensifying competitive interactions between susceptible and resistant parasites. Resource limitation prevented resistance emergence regardless of whether resistant mutants arose de novo or were experimentally added before drug treatment. Our work provides proof of principle that chemotherapy paired with an ``ecological'' intervention can slow the evolution of resistance to antimicrobial drugs, even when resistant pathogens are present at high frequencies. It also suggests that a broad range of previously untapped compounds could be used for treating infectious diseases.},

abstract = {The evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria has become one of the defining problems in modern biology. Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial therapy threatens to eliminate one of the pillars of the practice of modern medicine. Yet, in spite of the importance of this problem, only recently have the dynamics of the shift from antibiotic sensitivity to resistance in a bacterial population been studied. In this study, a novel chemostat method was used to observe the evolution of resistance to streptomycin in a sensitive population of Escherichia coli, which grew while the concentration of antibiotic was constantly increasing. The results indicate that resistant mutants remain at a low frequency for longer than expected and do not begin to rise to a high frequency until the antibiotic concentrations are above the measured MIC, creating a ?lull period? in which there were few bacterial cells growing in the chemostats. Overall, mutants resistant to streptomycin were found in {\textgreater}60{\%} of the experimental trial replicates. All of the mutants detected were found to have MICs far above the maximum levels of streptomycin to which they were exposed and reached a high frequency within 96 h.},

Although pleiotropy is a common phenomenon with broad implications, its molecular basis is unclear. Using functional genomic data of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, here we show that, compared with genes of low pleiotropy, highly pleiotropic genes participate in more biological processes through distribution of the protein products in more cellular components and involvement in more protein{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}protein interactions. However, the two groups of genes do not differ in the number of molecular functions or the number of protein domains per gene. Thus, pleiotropy is generally caused by a single molecular function involved in multiple biological processes. We also provide genomewide evidence that the evolutionary conservation of genes and gene sequences positively correlates with the level of gene pleiotropy.},

abstract = {We use computer simulations to investigate the amount of genetic variation for complex traits that can be revealed by single-SNP genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or regional heritability mapping (RHM) analyses based on full genome sequence data or SNP chips. We model a large population subject to mutation, recombination, selection, and drift, assuming a pleiotropic model of mutations sampled from a bivariate distribution of effects of mutations on a quantitative trait and fitness. The pleiotropic model investigated, in contrast to previous models, implies that common mutations of large effect are responsible for most of the genetic variation for quantitative traits, except when the trait is fitness itself. We show that GWAS applied to the full sequence increases the number of QTL detected by as much as 50{\%} compared to the number found with SNP chips but only modestly increases the amount of additive genetic variance explained. Even with full sequence data, the total amount of additive variance explained is generally below 50{\%}. Using RHM on the full sequence data, a slightly larger number of QTL are detected than by GWAS if the same probability threshold is assumed, but these QTL explain a slightly smaller amount of genetic variance. Our results also suggest that most of the missing heritability is due to the inability to detect variants of moderate effect ({\~{}}0.03-0.3 phenotypic SDs) segregating at substantial frequencies. Very rare variants, which are more difficult to detect by GWAS, are expected to contribute little genetic variation, so their eventual detection is less relevant for resolving the missing heritability problem.},

abstract = {Understanding adaptive evolution to differing environments requires studies of genetic variances, of natural selection, and of the genetic differentiation between populations. Plant physiological traits such as leaf size and water-use efficiency (the ratio of carbon gained per water lost) have been suggested by physiological plant ecologists to be important in local adaptation to environments differing in water availability. In this study, I raised families of Cakile edentula var lacustris derived from a wet-site population and a dry-site population in a common greenhouse environment to determine the degree of genetic differentiation between the two populations and the genetic architecture of the traits. The dry-site population had significantly smaller leaf size and significantly greater water-use efficiency than the wet-site population. I used a retrospective selection analysis to compare long-term selection inferred from these results to measures of phenotypic selection from a field experiment. Both direct measures in the field and the retrospective selection gradients were consistent with the hypothesis that greater water-use efficiency and smaller leaves were adaptive in drier environments. Though the correlation between population means for water-use efficiency and leaf size was negative, the genetic correlation within populations between water-use efficiency and leaf size was positive and thus would be expected to constrain the evolutionary response to selection.},

abstract = {One of the features of organisms that makes the study of biology so compelling is their apparent complexity. Molecular, cellular, developmental, physiological, neurological, and behavioral systems are each fascinating in and of themselves, but it is their interaction that generates what we see as the organism as a whole. By necessity, biologists have a tendency to break down organisms into their component parts to see how they work. Yet, no trait is an island (Dobzhansky 1956). In particular, we need to consider the organism in its entirety when looking at evolutionary change. This perspective is necessitated simply by the fact that it is the whole individual, not specific traits or particular alleles, that lives and dies. The whole individual is therefore the central unit of selection (Lewontin 1970). How can we deal with the complexity inherent in trying to integrate biological function and evolutionary change across the whole organism? Quantitative genetics provides an attractive potential framework because it attempts to summarize important features of the genetic system while focusing firmly at the level of the phenotype. The multiple trait (multivariate) formulations of quantitative genetics that we will discuss here can be seen both as a conceptual framework for integrating multiple systems at many levels and as a tool for making quantitative predictions about evolutionary change. Whether it succeeds on either count is the subject of active debate (Barton and Turelli 1989). Ways of successfully building upon the traditional statistical framework of quantitative genetics is one of the exciting areas of future growth within the field of evolutionary genetics.},

Here, we present the results of a massively parallel experiment designed to measure the full spectrum of possible fates of new beneficial mutations in hundreds of experimental yeast populations, whether these mutations are ultimately successful or not. Using strains in which a particular class of beneficial mutation is detectable by fluorescence, we followed the trajectories of these beneficial mutations across 592 independent populations for 1000 generations.

abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that genetic constraints should be widespread, but empirical support for their existence is surprisingly rare. Commonly applied univariate and bivariate approaches to detecting genetic constraints can underestimate their prevalence, with important aspects potentially tractable only within a multivariate framework. However, multivariate genetic analyses of data from natural populations are challenging because of modest sample sizes, incomplete pedigrees, and missing data. Here we present results from a study of a comprehensive set of life history traits (juvenile survival, age at first breeding, annual fecundity, and longevity) for both males and females in a wild, pedigreed, population of red deer (Cervus elaphus). We use factor analytic modeling of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and take a multivariate approach to estimating genetic constraints. We consider a range of metrics designed to assess the effect of G on the deflection of a predicted response to selection away from the direction of fastest adaptation and on the evolvability of the traits. We found limited support for genetic constraint through genetic covariances between traits, both within sex and between sexes. We discuss these results with respect to other recent findings and to the problems of estimating these parameters for natural populations.},

abstract = {Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail plate or nail bed. It does not usually cure itself and it can trigger more infectious lesions in other parts of the body. The reported prevalence of onychomycosis is increasing in Western countries, presumably due to lifestyle changes and the ageing of the population. Approximately 10{\%} of the general population, 20{\%} of the population aged{\textgreater}60 years, up to 50{\%} of people aged{\textgreater}70 years and up to one-third of diabetic individuals have onychomycosis. Care should be taken for the accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of toenail onychomycosis to prevent complications. Current treatment options have relatively limited therapeutic success, particularly long-term. Oral medications are associated with high recurrence rates and treatment failure, and are not suitable for many cases due to potential adverse effects. Topical medications are recommended only for mild to moderate cases. The cost of therapies may also be prohibitive in some cases. In the light of these issues, more research is warranted for the investigation and development of more effective and economical options for the treatment and prophylaxis of toenail onychomycosis. In patient populations such as diabetic individuals, where onychomycosis can provoke lower extremity complications, professional podiatry care of toenails and feet should be encouraged.},

abstract = {The constancy of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G matrix) across environments and populations has been discussed and tested empirically over the years but no consensus has so far been reached. In this paper, I present a model in which morphological traits develop hierarchically, and individuals differ in their resource allocation and acquisition patterns. If the variance in resource acquisition is many times larger than the variance in resource allocation then strong genetic correlations are expected, and with almost isometric relations among traits. As the variation in resource acquisition decreases below a certain threshold, the correlations decrease overall and the relations among traits become a function of the allocation patterns, and in particular reflecting the basal division of allocation. A strong bottleneck can break a pattern of strong genetic correlation, but this effect diminishes rapidly with increasing bottleneck size. This model helps to understand why some populations change their genetic correlations in different environments, whereas others do not, since the key factor is the relation between the variances in resource acquisition and allocation. If a change in environment does not lead to a change in this ratio, no change can be expected, whereas if the ratio is changed substantially then major changes can be expected. This model can also help to understand the constancy of morphological patterns within larger taxa as a function of constancy in resource acquisition patterns over time and environments. When this pattern breaks, for example on islands, larger changes can be expected.},

abstract = {Common principal components (CPC) analysis is a technique for assessing whether variance-covariance matrices from different populations have similar structure. One potential application is to compare additive genetic variance-covariance matrices, G. In this article, the conditions under which G matrices are expected to have common PCs are derived for a two-locus, two-allele model and the model of constrained pleiotropy. The theory demonstrates that whether G matrices are expected to have common PCs is largely determined by whether pleiotropic effects have a modular organization. If two (or more) populations have modules and these modules have the same direction, the G matrices have a common PC, regardless of allele frequencies. In the absence of modules, common PCs exist only for very restricted combinations of allele frequencies. Together, these two results imply that, when populations are evolving, common PCs are expected only when the populations have modules in common. These results have two implications: (1) In general, G matrices will not have common PCs, and (2) when they do, these PCs indicate common modular organization. The interpretation of common PCs identified for estimates of G matrices is discussed in light of these results.},

abstract = {We analytically study a deterministic model for the spread of drug resistance among human malaria parasites. The model incorporates all major characteristics of the complex malaria transmission cycle and accounts for the fact that only a fraction $\alpha$of infected hosts receive drug treatment. Furthermore, the model incorporates that hosts can be co-infected. The number m of parasites co-infecting a host is either a constant or, more generally, follows a given frequency distribution. Although the model is formulated in a multilocus setup, for our results we assume that drug resistance is caused by a single locus with two alleles -- a sensitive one and a resistant one. We assume that the resistant allele has a selective advantage only in treated hosts and pays metabolic costs, which causes this allele to be deleterious in untreated hosts. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the fixation of the resistant allele. Moreover, provided the resistant allele will sweep through the population, we derive a formula for the time until it reaches a given frequency and in particular for the time until quasi-fixation. Furthermore, we establish an analytical solution for allele frequency changes at a linked neutral biallelic locus due to the rapid increase in frequency of the resistant allele. Our solution describes a local reduction in heterozygosity among parasite chromosomes around the resistant allele, the effect commonly referred to as the hitchhiking effect, as a function of $\alpha$and m. The result therefore allows the investigation of selective sweep patterns under specific demographic settings. We find that the hitchhiking effect is similar but different from the standard model of genetic hitchhiking that assumes random mating and homogeneous selection. In particular, the process of recombination and selection cannot be decoupled. We further explain why standard hitchhiking theory cannot be applied to drug resistance in malaria. Furthermore, we will show that a genome-wide reduction in relative heterozygosity can occur provided a fraction of hosts is infected by a single parasite haplotype. Finally, we show how to incorporate host heterogeneity, and generalize our results to this biologically more realistic case.},

abstract = {Dynamic models of quantitative (polygenic) characters are more generally applicable in the analysis of life history evolution than are static optimization methods or one and two locus genetic models. A dynamic theory of life history evolution is derived by synthesizing population demography with quantitative genetics. In a population under weak selection with a nearly stable age distribution, the relative fitness of individuals with a particular life history phenotype can be approximated as an average of age-specific relative fecundity and mortality rates, weighted respectively by the present productivity and future reproductive value of each age-class. An adaptive topography is constructed showing that, with phenotype- and age-specific fecundity and mortality rates constant in time, evolution of the mean life history maximizes the intrinsic rate of increase of a population. However, the rate and direction of evolution in response to selection are strongly influenced by genetic correlations among characters. Negative genetic correlations among major components of fitness are often obscured phenotypically by positive environmental correlations, but commonly constitute the ultimate constraint on life history evolution, as illustrated by artificial selection experiments. Methods are suggested for measuring selective forces and evolutionary constraints that effect life history characters in natural populations.},

@book{MATHER1971,
abstract = {It could be argued that biometrical genetics is the foremost contribution of Birmingham to the world of learning in the present century. For this, the major credit goes to Professor Mather, and secondly to his principal collaborators, J. L. Jinks and B. J. Haynian. Biometrical Genetics was first published in 1949, with K. Mather as sole author [cf. XIX, p. 913]. It has undoubtedly been one of the most influential monographs of recent times. In the ensuing twenty years, extensive research into and extension of the ideas adumbrated in Mather's book have taken place, largely at Birmingham University, and the present second edition, of which Professor Jinks is now coauthor, though recognizably based on its predecessor, is so greatly enlarged as virtually to constitute a new work. It is the best guide to the research programme that Professor Mather has inspired. The present edition comprises twelve chapters. The first, on the genetical foundation, does not differ greatly from what went before; perhaps the mystique in which polygenes were originally enshrouded is now toned down. Chapter 2, on Characters, also follows the lines of the corresponding chapter in the earlier book. Chapter 3, however, is considerably changed and includes a description of recent work on the biometrical analysis of plasmatic variation. Scaling tests and scale transformation have been transferred to the next chapter, where they follow the treatment of additive and dominant components. It is difficult to avoid the impression that scale transformation is still the Achilles' heel of much of the elegant mathematical edifice which the authors present to us, especially when one finds, as is pointed out on p. 82, that a "scale which is satisfactory for fitting an additive-dominance model" may conflict with the "one which will normalize the distributions within the non-segregating generations". Chapter 5 has much new material and deals at length with nonallelic interaction, genotype x environment interaction and heterosis. In chapter 6, we pass on to the potentialities of 2nd degree statistics; this chapter reproduces much of the former chapter 4 on the partitioning of variance, with an interesting addition on weighted analysis. The chapter on linkage follows along the lines of the former chapter, but new examples are taken; in its final section the analysis of genotype x environment interaction proceeds one stage further. Chapter 8, in addition to treating randombreeding populations, formerly treated in chapter 4, also deals with the genetic study of twins, the genetics of experimental populations and the effect of partial inbreeding. Diallel analysis has been amongst the major preoccupation of the Birmingham School and is expounded at length in Chapter 9. Various special cases are treated in the next chapter, namely sex linkage, maternal effects, and the genetics of haploids and polyploids. The last two chapters follow the general lines of the final two chapters of the first edition. The first deals with the number of effective factors and the rate of advance under selection, both matters where the concordance between theory and practice has been unimpressive. The second, entitled Experiments and concepts, is able to review many carefully set up genetical experiments where the first edition was only able to refer to one as fully adequate, and even this one is not included in this chapter of the second edition. Opportunity is also taken here to attempt a rebuttal of some of the weightier criticims that current biometrical genetics has had to meet, notably by Gilbert [cf. XXXI, 2873], but hardly with sufficient force to disarm a persistent critic. The number of references in the bibliography has trebled in comparison with the former edition, and the current volume may be confidently recommended as definitive within its field.},

Recent developments include evidence that various antibiotics increase mutation rates in bacteria when used at subinhibitory concentrations. It is therefore suggested that such treatments promote resistance evolution because they increase the generation of genetic variation on which natural selection can act. However, existing methods to compute mutation rate neglect the effect of stress on death and population dynamics. Developing new experimental and computational tools, we find that taking death into account significantly lowers the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, we show that treatments that increase mutation rate do not always lead to increased genetic diversity, which questions the standard paradigm of increased evolvability under stress.},

abstract = {The development of reliable methods for restoring susceptibility after antibiotic resistance arises has proven elusive. A greater understanding of the relationship between antibiotic administration and the evolution of resistance is key to overcoming this challenge. Here we present a data-driven mathematical approach for developing antibiotic treatment plans that can reverse the evolution of antibiotic resistance determinants. We have generated adaptive landscapes for 16 genotypes of the TEM ?-lactamase that vary from the wild type genotype "TEM-1" through all combinations of four amino acid substitutions. We determined the growth rate of each genotype when treated with each of 15 ?-lactam antibiotics. By using growth rates as a measure of fitness, we computed the probability of each amino acid substitution in each ?-lactam treatment using two different models named the Correlated Probability Model (CPM) and the Equal Probability Model (EPM). We then performed an exhaustive search through the 15 treatments for substitution paths leading from each of the 16 genotypes back to the wild type TEM-1. We identified optimized treatment paths that returned the highest probabilities of selecting for reversions of amino acid substitutions and returning TEM to the wild type state. For the CPM model, the optimized probabilities ranged between 0.6 and 1.0. For the EPM model, the optimized probabilities ranged between 0.38 and 1.0. For cyclical CPM treatment plans in which the starting and ending genotype was the wild type, the probabilities were between 0.62 and 0.7. Overall this study shows that there is promise for reversing the evolution of resistance through antibiotic treatment plans.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of genotype--phenotype maps for different combinations of mutations has empowered evolutionary biologists with the tools to interrogate the predictability of adaptive evolution, especially in the context of the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Large microbial populations are known to generate competing beneficial mutations, but determining how these mutations contribute to the adaptive trajectories that are most likely to be followed remains a challenge. Despite a recognition that there may also be competition between successive alleles on the same trajectory, prior studies have not fully considered how this impacts adaptation rates along, or likelihood of following, individual trajectories. Here, we develop a metric that quantifies the competition between successive alleles along adaptive trajectories and show how this competition largely governs the rate of evolution in simulations on empirical fitness landscapes for proteins involved in drug resistance in two species of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax). Our findings reveal that a trajectory with a larger-than-average initial fitness increase may have smaller fitness increases in later steps, which slows adaptation. In some circumstances, these trajectories may be outcompeted by alleles on faster alternative trajectories that are being explored simultaneously. The ability to predict adaptation rates along accessible trajectories has implications for efforts to manage antimicrobial resistance in real-world settings and for the broader intellectual pursuit of predictive evolution in complex adaptive fitness landscapes for a variety of application domains.},

abstract = {Quantitative genetics has been introduced to evolutionary biologists with the suggestion that microevolution could be directly linked to macroevolutionary patterns using, among other parameters, the additive genetic variance/covariance matrix (G) which is a statistical representation of genetic constraints to evolution. However, little is known concerning the rate and pattern of evolution of G in nature, and it is uncertain whether the constraining effect of G is important over evolutionary time scales. To address these issues, seven species of field crickets from the genera Gryllus and Teleogryllus were reared in the laboratory, and quantitative genetic parameters for morphological traits were estimated from each of them using a nested full-sibling family design. We used three statistical approaches (T method, Flury hierarchy, and Mantel test) to compare G matrices or genetic correlation matrices in a phylogenetic framework. Results showed that G matrices were generally similar across species, with occasional differences between some species. We suggest that G has evolved at a low rate, a conclusion strengthened by the consideration that part of the observed across-species variation in G can be explained by the effect of a genotype by environment interaction. The observed pattern of G matrix variation between species could not be predicted by either morphological trait values or phylogeny. The constraint hypothesis was tested by comparing the multivariate orientation of the reconstructed ancestral G matrix to the orientation of the across-species divergence matrix (D matrix, based on mean trait values). The D matrix mainly revealed divergence in size and, to a much smaller extent, in a shape component related to the ovipositor length. This pattern of species divergence was found to be predictable from the ancestral G matrix in agreement with the expectation of the constraint hypothesis. Overall, these results suggest that the G matrix seems to have an influence on species divergence, and that macroevolution can be predicted, at least qualitatively, from quantitative genetic theory. Alternative explanations are discussed.},

abstract = {Background

In a rapidly changing world, it is of fundamental importance to understand processes constraining or facilitating adaptation through microevolution. As different traits of an organism covary, genetic correlations are expected to affect evolutionary trajectories. However, only limited empirical data are available.

Methodology/Principal Findings

We investigate the extent to which multivariate constraints affect the rate of adaptation, focusing on four morphological traits often shown to harbour large amounts of genetic variance and considered to be subject to limited evolutionary constraints. Our data set includes unique long-term data for seven bird species and a total of 10 populations. We estimate population-specific matrices of genetic correlations and multivariate selection coefficients to predict evolutionary responses to selection. Using Bayesian methods that facilitate the propagation of errors in estimates, we compare (1) the rate of adaptation based on predicted response to selection when including genetic correlations with predictions from models where these genetic correlations were set to zero and (2) the multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection to the average evolvability in random directions of the phenotypic space. We show that genetic correlations on average decrease the predicted rate of adaptation by 28{\%}. Multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection was systematically lower than average evolvability in random directions of space. These significant reductions in the rate of adaptation and reduced evolvability were due to a general nonalignment of selection and genetic variance, notably orthogonality of directional selection with the size axis along which most (60{\%}) of the genetic variance is found.

Conclusions

These results suggest that genetic correlations can impose significant constraints on the evolution of avian morphology in wild populations. This could have important impacts on evolutionary dynamics and hence population persistence in the face of rapid environmental},

@article{turelli1984heritable,
abstract = {Most quantitative traits in most populations exhibit heritable genetic variation. Lande proposed that high levels of heritable variation may be maintained by mutation in the face of stabilizing selection. Several analyses have appeared of two distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published analyses of these models lead to qualitatively different predictions concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic variance on the underlying biological parameters. A new asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows that the different predictions are not consequences of the number of alleles assumed but rather are attributable to assumptions concerning the relative magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the phenotypic effects of mutation, and the intensity of selection. This conclusion is reinforced by analysis of a model with triallelic loci. None of the approximate analyses presented are mathematically rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display the domains of validity for alternative approximations, numerically determined equilibria are presented. In addition, empirical estimates of mutation rates and selection intensity are reviewed, revealing weaknesses in both the data and its connection to the models. Although the mathematical results and underlying biological requirements of my analyses are quite different from those of Lande, the results do not refute his hypothesis that considerable additive genetic variance may be maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I argue that the validity of this hypothesis can only be determined with additional data and mathematics.},

abstract = {Most individuals carry at least some potentially deleterious variants in their genome. But the effects of these mutations on individuals are not well understood. Sohail et al. examined loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the genomes of humans and flies. They found that deleterious LOF mutations are further away from each other in the genome than expected by chance, which suggests that genetic interactions are driving selection. Thus, additional mutations do not exhibit an additive effect, and the overall selective parameter is not driven solely by the total number of mutations within the genome. This explains why high levels of variation can be maintained and why sex and recombination are advantageous.Science, this issue p. 539Negative selection against deleterious alleles produced by mutation influences within-population variation as the most pervasive form of natural selection. However, it is not known whether deleterious alleles affect fitness independently, so that cumulative fitness loss depends exponentially on the number of deleterious alleles, or synergistically, so that each additional deleterious allele results in a larger decrease in relative fitness. Negative selection with synergistic epistasis should produce negative linkage disequilibrium between deleterious alleles and, therefore, an underdispersed distribution of the number of deleterious alleles in the genome. Indeed, we detected underdispersion of the number of rare loss-of-function alleles in eight independent data sets from human and fly populations. Thus, selection against rare protein-disrupting alleles is characterized by synergistic epistasis, which may explain how human and fly populations persist despite high genomic mutation rates.},

We assayed quantitative genetic variation in a temporary-pond-dwelling population of Daphnia pulex over a full season to examine the role of nonadditive genetic variation and genetic disequilibrium in determining the short-term evolutionary trajectory of a cyclic parthenogen. Quantitative traits were influenced by three factors: (1) clonal selection significantly changed the population mean phenotype during the course of the growing season; (2) sexual reproduction and recombination led to significant changes in life-history trait means and the levels of expressed genetic variation, implying the presence of substantial nonadditive genetic variation and genetic disequilibrium; and (3) Egg-bank effects were found to be an important component of the realized year-to-year change. Additionally, we examined the impact of genetic disequilibria induced by clonal selection on the genetic (co)variance structure with a common principal components model. Clonal selection caused significant changes in the (co)variance structure that were eliminated by a single bout of random mating, suggesting that a build-up of disequilibria was the primary source of changes in the (co)variance structure. The results of this study highlight the complexity of natural selection operating on populations that undergo alternating phases of sexual and asexual reproduction.},

By contrast, 'antagonistic' pleiotropic loci may constrain adaptation by affecting variation of many traits and limiting the direction of trait correlations to vectors that are not favoured by selection.

@article{Barton1990,
abstract = {It is widely held that each gene typically affects many characters, and that each character is affected by many genes. Moreover, strong stabilizing selection cannot act on an indefinitely large number of independent traits. This makes it likely that heritable variation in any one trait is maintained as a side effect of polymorphisms which have nothing to do with selection on that trait. This paper examines the idea that variation is maintained as the pleiotropic side effect of either deleterious mutation, or balancing selection. If mutation is responsible, it must produce alleles which are only mildly deleterious (s approximately 10(-3)), but nevertheless have significant effects on the trait. Balancing selection can readily maintain high heritabilities; however, selection must be spread over many weakly selected polymorphisms if large responses to artificial selection are to be possible. In both classes of pleiotropic model, extreme phenotypes are less fit, giving the appearance of stabilizing selection on the trait. However, it is shown that this effect is weak (of the same order as the selection on each gene): the strong stabilizing selection which is often observed is likely to be caused by correlations with a limited number of directly selected traits. Possible experiments for distinguishing the alternatives are discussed.},

The results identify several factors affecting the speed of adaptation. One of the most important is organismal complexity?complex organisms adapt more slowly than simple ones when using mutations of the same phenotypic size. Thus, as Fisher foresaw, organisms pay a kind of cost of complexity. However, the magnitude of this cost is considerably larger than Fisher's analysis suggested.

@article{hill1966effect,
abstract = {(i) A computer simulation study has been made of selection on two linked loci in small populations, where both loci were assumed to have additive effects on the character under selection with no interaction between loci. If N is the effective population size, i the intensity of selection in standard units, alpha and beta measure the effects of the two loci on the character under selection as a proportion of the pheno-typic standard deviation and c is the crossover distance between them, it was shown that the selection process can be completely specified by Ni alpha, Ni beta and Nc and the initial gene frequencies and linkage disequilibrium coefficient. It is then easily possible to generalize from computer runs at only one population size. All computer runs assumed an initial population at linkage equilibrium between the two loci. Analysis of the results was greatly simplified by considering the influence of segregation at the second locus on the chance of fixation at the first (defined as the proportion of replicate lines in which the favoured allele was eventually fixed).

(ii) The effects of linkage are sufficiently described by Nc. The relationship between chance of fixation at the limit and linkage distance (expressed as 2Nc/(2Nc + 1)) was linear in the majority of computer runs.

(iii) When gene frequency changes under independent segregation were small, linkage had no effect on the advance under selection. In general, segregation at the second locus had no detectable influence on the chance of fixation at the first if the gene effects at the second were less than one-half those at the first. With larger gene effects at the second locus, the chance of fixation passed through a minimum and then rose again. For two loci to have a mutual influence on one another, their effects on the character under selection should not differ by a factor of more than two.

(iv) Under conditions of suitable relative gene effects, the influence of segregation at the second locus was very dependent on the initial frequency of the desirable allele. The chance of fixation at the first, plotted against initial frequency of the desirable allele at the second, passed through a minimum when the chance of fixation at the second locus was about 0.8.

(v) A transformation was found which made the influence of segregation at the second locus on the chance of fixation at the first almost independent of initial gene frequency at the first and of gene effects at the first locus when these are small.

(vi) In the population of gametes at final fixation, linkage was not at equilibrium and there was an excess of repulsion gametes.

(vii) The results were extended to a consideration of the effect of linkage on the limits under artificial selection. Linkage proved only to be of importance when the two loci had roughly equal effects on the character under selection. The maximum effect on the advance under selection occurred when the chance of fixation at both of the loci was between 0.7 and 0.8. When the advance under selection is most sensitive to changes in recombination value, a doubling of the latter in no case increased the advance under selection by more than about 6{\%}. The proportion selected to give maximum advance under individual selection (0.5 under independent segregation) was increased, but only very slightly, when linkage is important.

(viii) These phenomena could be satisfactorily accounted for in terms of the time scale of the selection process and the effective size of the population within which changes of gene frequency at the locus with smaller effect must take place.},

The conventional approach to this problem is to measure the range of antibiotic concentrations over which resistance is selectively favoured - the {\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}mutant selection window{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}. Here we take an alternative approach by investigating how antibiotic concentration impacts de novo establishment of resistance from single cells of a streptomycin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain. We show that demographic stochasticity prevents outgrowth of resistant cells with {\textgreater}95{\%} probability across {\~{}}90{\%} of the range of streptomycin concentrations where resistance is selectively favoured. This effect occurs because exposure to streptomycin extends lag time and increases the mortality rate of streptomycin-resistant cells. Our study highlights fundamental differences between the processes that drive emergence versus spread of resistance. It suggests that moderate doses of antibiotics, within the traditional mutant selection window, may effectively prevent emergence of resistance in cases where transmission of resistant strains is negligible, for instance when using new antibiotics.},

We tested the hypothesis that parasitoids with different strategies select for alternative host defense characteristics and in doing so contribute to the maintenance of fitness variation and produce trade-offs among traits. We characterized defense traits of Drosophila when exposed to parasitoids with different host searching behaviors (Aphaereta sp. and Leptopilina boulardi). We used host larvae with different natural alleles of the gene Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), a gene controlling the production of dopamine and known to influence the immune response against parasitoids. Previous population genetic analyses indicate that our focal alleles are maintained by balancing selection. Genotypes exhibited a trade-off between the immune response against Aphaereta sp. and the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi. We also identified a trade-off between the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi and larval competitive ability as indicated by differences in foraging and feeding behavior. Genotypes differed in dopamine levels potentially explaining variation in these traits. Our results highlight the potential role of parasitoid biodiversity on host fitness variation and implicate Ddc as an antagonistic pleiotropic locus influencing larval fitness traits.},

The comparison of G-matrices is a nontrivial statistical problem because family structure induces nonindependence among the elements in each matrix. Past solutions to the problem of G-matrix comparison have dealt with this problem, with varying success, but have tested a single null hypothesis (matrix equality or matrix dissimilarity). Because matrices can differ in many ways, several hypotheses are of interest in matrix comparisons. Flury (1988) has provided an approach to matrix comparison in which a variety of hypotheses are tested, including the two extreme hypotheses prevalent in the evolutionary literature. The hypotheses are arranged in a hierarchy and involve comparisons of both the principal components (eigenvectors) and eigenvalues of the matrix. We adapt Flury's hierarchy of tests to the problem of comparing G-matrices by using randomization testing to account for nonindependence induced by family structure. Software has been developed for carrying out this analysis for both genetic and phenotypic data. The method is illustrated with a garter snake test case.},

Two of the populations were derived from lines that had undergone selection for large or small thorax length over the preceding 23 generations. A third population was constituted using flies from control lines that were maintained with equivalent population sizes as the selected lines. The fourth population contained flies from the original cage population from which the selected and control lines had been started. Tests of the homogeneity of covariance matrices using maximum likelihood techniques revealed significant changes in covariance structure among the selected lines. Prediction of base population trait means from selected line means under the assumption of constant genetic covariances indicated that genetic covariances for the small population differed more from the base population than did the covariances for the large population. The predicted small population means diverged farther from the expected means because the additive genetic variance associated with several traits increased in value and most of the genetic covariances associated with one trait changed in sign. These results illustrate that genetic covariances may remain nearly constant in some situations while changing markedly in others. Possible developmental reasons for the genetic changes are discussed.},

It may adapt either through new beneficial mutations that subsequently sweep through the population or by using alleles from the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory to calculate the probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then determine the parameter regions where each scenarioâstanding variation vs. new mutationsâis more likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation are favored if either the selective advantage is weak or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of âsoft sweeps,â where multiple copies of the selected allele contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps with weaker selective footprints are likely under both scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection coefficient is high.},

abstract = {Malaria infections frequently consist of mixtures of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive parasites. If crowding occurs, where clonal population densities are suppressed by the presence of coinfecting clones, removal of susceptible clones by drug treatment could allow resistant clones to expand into the newly vacated niche space within a host. Theoretical models show that, if such competitive release occurs, it can be a potent contributor to the strength of selection, greatly accelerating the rate at which resistance spreads in a population. A variety of correlational field data suggest that competitive release could occur in human malaria populations, but direct evidence cannot be ethically obtained from human infections. Here we show competitive release after pyrimethamine curative chemotherapy of acute infections of the rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice. The expansion of resistant parasite numbers after treatment resulted in enhanced transmission-stage densities. After the elimination or near-elimination of sensitive parasites, the number of resistant parasites increased beyond that achieved when a competitor had never been present. Thus, a substantial competitive release occurred, markedly elevating the fitness advantages of drug resistance above those arising from survival alone. This finding may explain the rapid spread of drug resistance and the subsequently brief useful lifespans of some antimalarial drugs. In a second experiment, where subcurative chemotherapy was administered, the resistant clone was only partly released from competitive suppression and experienced a restriction in the size of its expansion after treatment. This finding raises the prospect of harnessing in-host ecology to slow the spread of drug resistance.},

Although individual studies have documented environmentally induced changes in genetic correlations, the nature and extent of environmental effects on multivariate genetic architecture across species and environments remain largely uncharacterized. We reviewed the literature for estimates of the genetic variance-covariance (G) matrix in multiple environments, and compared differences in G between environments to the divergence in G between conspecific populations (measured in a common garden). We found that the predicted evolutionary trajectory differed as strongly between environments as it did between populations. Between-environment differences in the underlying structure of G (total genetic variance and the relative magnitude and orientation of genetic correlations) were equal to or greater than between-population differences. Neither environmental novelty, nor the difference in mean phenotype predicted these differences in G. Our results suggest that environmental effects on multivariate genetic architecture may be comparable to the divergence that accumulates over dozens or hundreds of generations between populations. We outline avenues of future research to address the limitations of existing data and characterize the extent to which lability in genetic correlations shapes evolution in changing environments.},

Optimizing the duration and dosing of treatment to minimize the duration of symptomatic infection and selection pressure for resistance simultaneously has the potential to extend the useful therapeutic life of these valuable life-saving drugs without compromising the interests of individual patients. Here, using mathematical models, we explore the theoretical basis for shorter durations of treatment courses, including a range of ecological dynamics of bacteria that cause infections or colonize hosts as commensals. We find that immunity is an important mediating factor in determining the need for long duration of treatment. When immunity to infection is expected, shorter durations that reduce the selection for resistance without interfering with successful clinical outcome are likely to be supported. Adjusting drug treatment strategies to account for the impact of the differences in the ecological niche occupied by commensal flora relative to invasive bacteria could be effective in delaying the spread of bacterial resistance.},

abstract = {According to a classical narrative, early geneticists, failing to see how Mendelism provides the missing pieces of Darwin's theory, rejected gradual changes and advocated an implausible yet briefly popular view of evolution-by-mutation; after decades of delay (in which synthesis was prevented by personal conflicts, disciplinary rivalries, and anti-Darwinian animus), Darwinism emerged on a new Mendelian basis. Based on the works of four influential early geneticists â Bateson, de Vries, Morgan and Punnett â, and drawing on recent scholarship, we offer an alternative that turns the classical view on its head. For early geneticists, embracing discrete inheritance and the mutation theory (for the origin of hereditary variation) did not entail rejection of selection, but rejection of Darwin's non-Mendelian views of heredity and variation, his doctrine of natura non facit saltum, and his conception of ânatural selectionâ as a creative force that shapes features out of masses of infinitesimal differences. We find no evidence of a delay in synthesizing mutation, rules of discrete inheritance, and selection in a Mendelian-Mutationist Synthesis. Instead, before 1918, early geneticists had conceptualized allelic selection, the HardyâWeinberg equilibrium, the evolution of a quantitative trait under selection, the probability of fixation of a new mutation, and other key innovations. Contemporary evolutionary thinking seems closer to their more ecumenical view than to the restrictive mid-twentieth-century consensus known as the Modern Synthesis.},

Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.},

Two new approaches are applied that extend the comparative method to multivariate data. The efficacy of these techniques are compared, and their sensitivity to sampling error examined. Pairwise matrix correlations of correlation matrices are consistently very high ({\textgreater} 0.90) and show no significant association between matrix similarity and phylogenetic relatedness. Hierarchical decomposition of common principal component (CPC) analyses applied to each clade in the phylogeny rejects the hypothesis that common principal component structure is shared in clades more inclusive than subspecies. Most subspecies also lack a common covariance structure as described by the CPC model. The hypothesis of constant covariances must be rejected, but the magnitudes of divergence in covariance structure appear to be small. Matrix correlations are very sensitive to sampling error, while CPC is not. CPC is a powerful statistical tool that allows detailed testing of underlying patterns of covariation.},

Many questions posed by Galton, Weldon, and Pearson remain only partially answered. Weldon (248) asserted that "the problem of animal evolution is essentially a statistical problem," and argued that legitimate conjectures on macroevolution must be based on understanding the factors shaping microevolution: variation, selection, and
heredity. As he not,????????????d, this demands statistical analysis of phenotypic variation (including both variances and correlations), of fitness as a function of phenotype, and of the similarities between parents and offspring. His call, in 1893 , for additional empirical studies of selection in the wild was repeated by Endler in 1986. In his first statistical analyses of multiple characters, Weldon (247, 248) asked whether phenotypic correlations an{\textless}t variances from one population were applicable to others. Like Lofsvold (156) and Kohn {\&} Atchley ( 129), he l'ound that correlations were relatively constant, but variances were not. This question of relative constancy of quantitative genetic parameters remains central to evaluations of macroevolutionary analyses that assume constant genetic parameters ( 170, 237).},

abstract = {Theoretical quantitative genetics provides a framework for reconstructing past selection and predicting future patterns of phenotypic differentiation. However, the usefulness of the equations of quantitative genetics for evolutionary inference relies on the evolutionary stability of the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix (G matrix). A fruitful new approach for exploring the evolutionary dynamics of G involves the use of individual-based computer simulations. Previous studies have focused on the evolution of the eigenstructure of G. An alternative approach employed in this paper uses the multivariate response-to-selection equation to evaluate the stability of G. In this approach, I measure similarity by the correlation between response-to-selection vectors due to random selection gradients. I analyze the dynamics of G under several conditions of correlational mutation and selection. As found in a previous study, the eigenstructure of G is stabilized by correlational mutation and selection. However, over broad conditions, instability of G did not result in a decreased consistency of the response to selection. I also analyze the stability of G when the correlation coefficients of correlational mutation and selection and the effective population size change through time. To my knowledge, no prior study has used computer simulations to investigate the stability of G when correlational mutation and selection fluctuate. Under these conditions, the eigenstructure of G is unstable under some simulation conditions. Different results are obtained if G matrix stability is assessed by eigenanalysis or by the response to random selection gradients. In this case, the response to selection is most consistent when certain aspects of the eigenstructure of G are least stable and vice versa.},

abstract = {We review and discuss the importance of correlational selection (selection for optimal character combinations) in natural populations. If two or more traits subject to multivariate selection are heritable, correlational selection builds favourable genetic correlations through the formation of linkage disequilibrium at underlying loci governing the traits. However, linkage disequilibria built up by correlational selection are expected to decay rapidly (ie, within a few generations), unless correlational selection is strong and chronic. We argue that frequency-dependent biotic interactions that have 'Red Queen dynamics' (eg, host-parasite interactions, predator-prey relationships or intraspecific arms races) often fuel chronic correlational selection, which is strong enough to maintain adaptive genetic correlations of the kind we describe. We illustrate these processes and phenomena using empirical examples from various plant and animal systems, including our own recent work on the evolutionary dynamics of a heritable throat colour polymorphism in the side-blotched lizard Uta stansburiana. In particular, male and female colour morphs of side-blotched lizards cycle on five- and two-generation (year) timescales under the force of strong frequency-dependent selection. Each morph refines the other morph in a Red Queen dynamic. Strong correlational selection gradients among life history, immunological and morphological traits shape the genetic correlations of the side-blotched lizard polymorphism. We discuss the broader evolutionary consequences of the buildup of co-adapted trait complexes within species, such as the implications for speciation processes.},

@article{Roff1999,
abstract = {Predictions using quantitative genetic models generally assume that the variance-covariance matrices remain constant over time. This assumption is based on the supposition that selection is generally weak and hence variation lost through selection can be replaced by new mutations. Whether this is generally true can only be ascertained from empirical studies. Ideally for such a study we should be able to make a prediction concerning the relative strength of selection versus genetic drift. If the latter force is prevalent then the variance-covariances matrices should be proportional to each other. Previous studies have indicated that females in the two sibling cricket species Allonemobius socius and A. fasciatus do not discriminate between males of the two species by their calling song. Therefore, differences between the calling song of the two males most likely result from drift rather than sexual selection. We test this hypothesis by comparing the genetic architecture of calling song of three populations of A. fasciatus with two populations of A. socius. We found no differences among populations within species, but significant differences in the G (genetic) and P (phenotypic) matrices between species, with the matrices being proportional as predicted under the hypothesis of genetic drift. Because of the proportional change in the (co)variances no differences between species are evident in the heritabilities or genetic correlations. Comparison of the two species with a hybrid population from a zone of overlap showed highly significant nonproportional variation in genetic architecture. This variation is consistent with a general mixture of two separate genomes or selection. Qualitative conclusions reached using the phenotypic matrices are the same as those reached using the genetic matrices supporting the hypothesis that the former may be used as surrogate measures of the latter.},

abstract = {Adaptation lies at the heart of Darwinian evolution. Accordingly, numerous studies have tried to provide a formal framework for the description of the adaptive process. Of these, two complementary modeling approaches have emerged: While so-called adaptive-walk models consider adaptation from the successive fixation of de novo mutations only, quantitative genetic models assume that adaptation proceeds exclusively from preexisting standing genetic variation. The latter approach, however, has focused on short-term evolution of population means and variances rather than on the statistical properties of adaptive substitutions. Our aim is to combine these two approaches by describing the ecological and genetic factors that determine the genetic basis of adaptation from standing genetic variation in terms of the effect-size distribution of individual alleles. Specifically, we consider the evolution of a quantitative trait to a gradually changing environment. By means of analytical approximations, we derive the distribution of adaptive substitutions from standing genetic variation, that is, the distribution of the phenotypic effects of those alleles from the standing variation that become fixed during adaptation. Our results are checked against individual-based simulations. We find that, compared to adaptation from de novo mutations, (i) adaptation from standing variation proceeds by the fixation of more alleles of small effect and (ii) populations that adapt from standing genetic variation can traverse larger distances in phenotype space and, thus, have a higher potential for adaptation if the rate of environmental change is fast rather than slow.},

These findings are consistent with popular interpretations of Fisher's (1930, 1958) Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, and Falconer (1960, 1981), but also indicate that high heritabilities are maintained within natural populations even for traits believed to be under strong selection.

Claiming that ?the neutral theory has been overwhelmingly rejected,? they propose instead that natural selection is the major force shaping both between-species divergence and within-species variation. Although this is probably a minority view, it is important to evaluate such claims carefully in the context of current knowledge, as inaccuracies can sometimes morph into an accepted narrative for those not familiar with the underlying science. We here critically examine and ultimately reject Kern and Hahn's arguments and assessment, and instead propose that it is now abundantly clear that the foundational ideas presented five decades ago by Kimura and Ohta are indeed correct.},

abstract = {Many experimental and field studies have shown that adaptation can occur very rapidly. Two qualitatively different modes of fast adaptation have been proposed: selective sweeps wherein large shifts in the allele frequencies occur at a few loci and evolution via small changes in the allele frequencies at many loci. Although the first process has been thoroughly investigated within the framework of population genetics, the latter is based on quantitative genetics and is much less understood. Here we summarize results from our recent theoretical studies of a quantitative genetic model of polygenic adaptation that makes explicit reference to population genetics to bridge the gap between the two frameworks. Our key results are that polygenic adaptation may be a rapid process and can proceed via subtle or dramatic changes in the allele frequency depending on the sizes of the phenotypic effects relative to a threshold value. We also discuss how the signals of polygenic selection may be detected in the genome. Although powerful methods are available to identify signatures of selective sweeps at loci controlling quantitative traits, the development of statistical tests for detecting small shifts of allele frequencies at quantitative trait loci is still in its infancy.},

Matrix comparisons using both Flury and multivariate analysis of variance methods revealed significant differences in G matrices both between populations and between treatments within populations, the former being generally larger than the latter.

abstract = {A basic principle of natural selection on correlated characters is expressed as an adaptive topography for the vector of mean phenotypes in a population. Under some simple conditions on the pattern of phenotypic and genetic covariation within populations, selection only on body size, certain types of multivariate selection, and random genetic drift in a stochastic phylogeny are each expected to produce allometric evolution, i.e., straight lines or linear regressions on logarithmic coordinates. The orientation of these lines is determined by genetic parameters of the populations. Using this theory, phylogenetic or comparative information can be combined with experimental data on population genetic parameters to test hypotheses about past selective forces. Data from selection experiments on brain and body weights in mice support the conclusions that [1] the short-term differentiation of brain and body sizes in very closely related mammalian forms resulted either from directional selection mostly on body size with changes in brain sizes largely a genetically correlated response, or from random genetic drift; [2] during the long-term allometric diversification within most mammalian orders there has been more net directional selection on brain sizes than on body sizes. It is suggested that encephalization in primates decreased the genetic correlation between brain size and body size within populations, which facilitated further encephalization in the human lineage by avoiding antagonistic selection on brain and body sizes.

Here, we describe a method for distinguishing between the two processes that likely account for biased rates of substitution: variation in mutation rates and variation in the probability that a mutation becomes fixed once it arises. We then use this approach to examine the type and magnitude of these biases during evolutionary transitions across multiple scales: those involving repeated origins of individual traits (flower color change), and transitions involving broad suites of traits (morphological and physiological trait evolution in plants and animals). We show that fixation biases can be strong at both levels of comparison, likely due to differences in the magnitude of deleterious pleiotropy associated with alternative mutation categories. However, we also show that the scale at which these comparisons are made greatly influences the results, as broad comparisons that simultaneously analyze mutliple traits obscure heterogeneity in the direction and magnitude of these biases. We conclude that preferential fixation of mutations likely is common in nature, but should be studied on a trait-by-trait basis.},

abstract = {When large asexual populations adapt, competition between simultaneously segregating mutations slows the rate of adaptation and restricts the set of mutations that eventually fix. This phenomenon of interference arises from competition between mutations of different strengths as well as competition between mutations that arise on different fitness backgrounds. Previous work has explored each of these effects in isolation, but the way they combine to influence the dynamics of adaptation remains largely unknown. Here, we describe a theoretical model to treat both aspects of interference in large populations. We calculate the rate of adaptation and the distribution of fixed mutational effects accumulated by the population. We focus particular attention on the case when the effects of beneficial mutations are exponentially distributed, as well as on a more general class of exponential-like distributions. In both cases, we show that the rate of adaptation and the influence of genetic background on the fixation of new mutants is equivalent to an effective model with a single selection coefficient and rescaled mutation rate, and we explicitly calculate these effective parameters. We find that the effective selection coefficient exactly coincides with the most common fixed mutational effect. This equivalence leads to an intuitive picture of the relative importance of different types of interference effects, which can shift dramatically as a function of the population size, mutation rate, and the underlying distribution of fitness effects.},

abstract = {Environmental antibiotic risk management requires an understanding of how subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations contribute to the spread of resistance. We develop a simple model of competition between sensitive and resistant bacterial strains to predict the minimum selection concentration (MSC), the lowest level of antibiotic at which resistant bacteria are selected. We present an analytical solution for the MSC based on the routinely measured MIC, the selection coefficient (sc) that expresses fitness differences between strains, the intrinsic net growth rate, and the shape of the bacterial growth dose-response curve with antibiotic or metal exposure (the Hill coefficient [$\kappa$]). We calibrated the model by optimizing the Hill coefficient to fit previously reported experimental growth rate difference data. The model fit varied among nine compound-taxon combinations examined but predicted the experimentally observed MSC/MIC ratio well (R2 {\textgreater}= 0.95). The shape of the antibiotic response curve varied among compounds (0.7 {\textless}= $\kappa${\textless}= 10.5), with the steepest curve being found for the aminoglycosides streptomycin and kanamycin. The model was sensitive to this antibiotic response curve shape and to the sc, indicating the importance of fitness differences between strains for determining the MSC. The MSC can be {\textgreater}1 order of magnitude lower than the MIC, typically by the factor sc$\kappa$. This study provides an initial quantitative depiction and a framework for a research agenda to examine the growing evidence of selection for resistant bacterial communities at low environmental antibiotic concentrations.},

We derive compact analytical approximations for the fixation probability and the distribution of passage times for the beneficial allele to reach a given intermediate frequency. We apply the formalism to several biologically relevant scenarios, such as linear or cyclic changes in the selection coefficient, and logistic population growth.

This causes a reduction in variability at linked neutral or nearly neutral sites, as well as distortions of the genealogies of samples of alleles from a population. In regions of the genome where recombination is frequent, the effects of selection against deleterious mutations on variability and evolution at linked sites can be predicted under the assumption that most deleterious mutations have such large effects that their behavior in the population is effectively deterministic-this is background selection in the strict sense. But in genomic regions with little or no recombination, such as the Y chromosome, large departures from the predictions using deterministic models may occur, because of interference between different sites under selection. Evidence from Drosophila and human populations is discussed, which suggests that these processes play a major role in shaping patterns of DNA sequence variation and evolution, including the relative levels of variation on X chromosomes and autosomes, and the highly reduced variability seen in regions that lack crossing over.},

abstract = {A multivariate quantitative genetic model is analyzed that is based on the assumption that the genetic variation at a locus j primarily influences an underlying physiological variable yj, while influence on the genotypic values is determined by a kind of "developmental function" which is not changed by mutations at this locus. Assuming additivity among loci the developmental function becomes a linear transformation of the underlying variables y onto the genotypic values x, x = By. In this way the pleiotropic effects become constrained by the structure of the B-matrix. The equilibrium variance under mutation-stabilizing selection balance in infinite and finite populations is derived by using the house of cards approximation. The results are compared to the predictions given by M. Turelli in 1985 for pleiotropic two-character models. It is shown that the B-matrix model gives the same results as Turelli's five-allele model, suggesting that the crucial factor determining the equilibrium variance in multivariate models with pleiotropy is the assumption about constraints on the pleiotropic effects, and not the number of alleles as proposed by Turelli. Finally it is shown that under Gaussian stabilizing selection the structure of the B-matrix has effectively no influence on the mean equilibrium fitness of an infinite population. Hence the B-matrix and consequently to some extent also the structure of the genetic correlation matrix is an almost neutral character. The consequences for the evolution of genetic covariance matrices are discussed.},

These analyses reveal convergence, divergence, and often a complicated mix thereof. Complications include concordance in the direction of evolutionary change with sustained quantitative variation among populations, and the potential for a given trait to exhibit divergence on one timescale and convergence on another.

abstract = {Studies of spatial variation in the environment have primarily focused on how genetic variation can be maintained. Many one-locus genetic models have addressed this issue, but, for several reasons, these models are not directly applicable to quantitative (polygenic) traits. One reason is that for continuously varying characters, the evolution of the mean phenotype expressed in different environments (the norm of reaction) is also of interest. Our quantitative genetic models describe the evolution of phenotypic response to the environment, also known as phenotypic plasticity (Gause, 1947), and illustrate how the norm of reaction (Schmalhausen, 1949) can be shaped by selection. These models utilize the statistical relationship which exists between genotype-environment interaction and genetic correlation to describe evolution of the mean phenotype under soft and hard selection in coarse-grained environments. Just as genetic correlations among characters within a single environment can constrain the response to simultaneous selection, so can a genetic correlation between states of a character which are expressed in two environments. Unless the genetic correlation across environments is ? 1, polygenic variation is exhausted, or there is a cost to plasticity, panmictic populations under a bivariate fitness function will eventually attain the optimum mean phenotype for a given character in each environment. However, very high positive or negative correlations can substantially slow the rate of evolution and may produce temporary maladaptation in one environment before the optimum joint phenotype is finally attained.

Evolutionary trajectories under hard and soft selection can differ: in hard selection, the environments with the highest initial mean fitness contribute most individuals to the mating pool. In both hard and soft selection, evolution toward the optimum in a rare environment is much slower than it is in a common one.

A subdivided population model reveals that migration restriction can facilitate local adaptation. However, unless there is no migration or one of the special cases discussed for panmictic populations holds, no geographical variation in the norm of reaction will be maintained at equilibrium. Implications of these results for the interpretation of spatial patterns of phenotypic variation in natural populations are discussed.},

Mitigation of biodiversity loss requires science that integrates both ecological and evolutionary responses of populations and communities to rapid environmental change, and can identify the conditions that allow the recovery of declining populations. This special issue focuses on evolutionary rescue (ER), the idea that evolution might occur sufficiently fast to arrest population decline and allow population recovery before extinction ensues. ER emphasizes a shift to a perspective on evolutionary dynamics that focuses on short time-scales, genetic variants of large effects and absolute rather than relative fitness. The contributions in this issue reflect the state of field; the articles address the latest conceptual developments, and report novel theoretical and experimental results. The examples in this issue demonstrate that this burgeoning area of research can inform problems of direct practical concern, such as the conservation of biodiversity, adaptation to climate change and the emergence of infectious disease. The continued development of research on ER will be necessary if we are to understand the extent to which anthropogenic global change will reduce the Earth's biodiversity. },

abstract = {There are two simple caricatures of evolutionary dynamics: the phenotypic caricature focuses on continuous and predictable selection on variability of quantitative traits, whereas the genotypic caricature focuses on discrete, stochastic mutations. Although the apparent contradictions between these pictures were reconciled long ago, our quantitative understanding of the interplay between them is still surprisingly primitive. Indeed, even the simplest models of the dynamics of large asexual populations in which many alleles and many new mutations contribute to the evolving fitness have resisted solution. The PNAS paper by Hallatschek (1) is a substantial advance in the development of the mathematical methods needed to analyze these and more complex models.

What is the source of the basic difficulty? The Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection describes, quantitatively, how a diverse population subject to selective pressure evolves. It states that the rate of change of the average of a quantitative trait is proportional to the hereditable part of the variance of that trait times the strength of selection for it. But what determines the variance of a trait that is under selection? Initially, the frequencies of the various alleles that contribute to it: if there are many of these, the sum of their positive and negative contributions will give rise to a roughly normal bell-shaped distribution of the fitness. However, as selection proceeds, some of the alleles will rise to fixation and others die out. Thus, under steady selection, after a modest time, only the beneficial alleles will remain and there will be no variance at all: the increase in fitness then comes to a grinding halt. But of course there can be new beneficial mutations. If only one such mutation arose at a time, it would sweep through the population before another occurred: this is the simple population genetics caricature of discrete mutation-selection events. ...},

However, in many species, experimental control over important factors that regulate division of labor, such as genotype and age, is limited [1, 2]. Furthermore, most species have fixed queen and worker castes, making it difficult to establish causality between the molecular mechanisms that underlie reproductive division of labor, the hallmark of insect societies [3]. Here we present the genome of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, a powerful new study system that does not suffer from these constraints. Using cytology and RAD-seq, we show that C. biroi reproduces via automixis with central fusion and that heterozygosity is lost extremely slowly. As a consequence, nestmates are almost clonally related (r = 0.996). Workers in C. biroi colonies synchronously alternate between reproduction and brood care, and young workers eclose in synchronized cohorts. We show that genes associated with division of labor in other social insects are conserved in C. biroi and dynamically regulated during the colony cycle. With unparalleled experimental control over an individual's genotype and age, and the ability to induce reproduction and brood care [4, 5], C. biroi has great potential to illuminate the molecular regulation of division of labor. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

When density dependence is weak or negative, the effective population size of the front scales only logarithmically with the carrying capacity. The dependence, however, switches to a sublinear power law and then to a linear increase as the density dependence becomes strongly positive. We develop a unified framework revealing that the transitions between different regimes of diversity loss are controlled by a single, universal quantity: the ratio of the expansion velocity to the geometric mean of dispersal and growth rates at expansion edge. Our results suggest that positive density dependence could dramatically alter evolution in expanding populations even when its contribution to the expansion velocity is small.},

Here we set out to better understand the repeatability of evolution, which is a necessary condition for predictability. We explored experimentally the effect of mutation supply and the strength of selective pressure on the repeatability of selection from standing genetic variation. Different sizes of mutant libraries of antibiotic resistance gene TEM-1 ?-lactamase in Escherichia coli, generated by error-prone PCR, were subjected to different antibiotic concentrations. We determined whether populations went extinct or survived, and sequenced the TEM gene of the surviving populations. The distribution of mutations per allele in our mutant libraries followed a Poisson distribution. Extinction patterns could be explained by a simple stochastic model that assumed the sampling of beneficial mutations was key for survival. In most surviving populations, alleles containing at least one known large-effect beneficial mutation were present. These genotype data also support a model which only invokes sampling effects to describe the occurrence of alleles containing large-effect driver mutations. Hence, evolution is largely predictable given cursory knowledge of mutational fitness effects, the mutation rate and population size. There were no clear trends in the repeatability of selected mutants when we considered all mutations present. However, when only known large-effect mutations were considered, the outcome of selection is less repeatable for large libraries, in contrast to expectations. We show experimentally that alleles carrying multiple mutations selected from large libraries confer higher resistance levels relative to alleles with only a known large-effect mutation, suggesting that the scarcity of high-resistance alleles carrying multiple mutations may contribute to the decrease in repeatability at large library sizes.},

When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1,239 replacements (544 transitions, 695 transversions), the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval 50 to 56) compared with the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared with that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, the available data have the power to verify the ``conservative transition'' hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.}},

Increasing mutation rates may however allow adaptation to more intense stress, raising concerns about the effectiveness of treatments against pathogens. This previous work assumes that populations are rescued by the rise of a single resistance mutation. However, even in asexual organisms, rescue can also stem from the accumulation of multiple mutations in a single genome. Here, we extend previous work to study the rescue process in an asexual population where the mutation rate is sufficiently high so that such events may be common. We predict both the ultimate extinction probability of the population and the distribution of extinction times. We compare the accuracy of different approximations covering a large range of mutation rates. Moderate increase in mutation rates favors evolutionary rescue. However, larger increase leads to extinction by the accumulation of a large mutation load, a process called lethal mutagenesis. We discuss how these results could help design âevolution-proofâ antipathogen treatments that even highly mutable strains could not overcome.},

The former suffices in systems whose size and interactions do not change substantially over time, while the latter is a key property of open-ended evolution, where new players and interaction types enter the game. We first investigate systems from physics, biology, and engineering and argue that their evolutionary optimization dynamics is the cumulative effect of multiple independent events, or quakes, which are uniformly distributed on a logarithmic time scale and produce a decelerating fitness improvement when using the appropriate independent variable. The appropriate independent variable can be physical time for a disordered magnetic system, the number of generations for a bacterial system, or the number of produced units for a particular technological product. We then derive and discuss a simple microscopic theory that explains the nature of the involved optimization processes, and provide simulation results as illustration. Finally, we explore the evolution of human culture and technology, using empirical economic data as a proxy for human fitness. Assuming the overall dynamics is a combined optimization and expansion process, the two processes can be separated and quantified by superimposing the mathematical form of an optimization process on the empirical data and thereby transforming the independent variable. This variable turns out to increase faster than any exponential function of time, a property likely due to strong historical changes in the web of human interactions and to the associated increase in the amount of available knowledge. A microscopic theory for this time dependence remains, however, a challenging open problem.

 selection. We found evidence for nonneutral signals on variation
 underlying several traits (body mass index {[}BMI], schizophrenia,
 Crohn's disease, educational attainment, and height). We then used
 simulations that incorporate simultaneous negative and positive
 selection to show that these signals are consistent with mutational bias
 and shifts in the fitness-phenotype relationship, but not stabilizing
 selection or mutational bias alone. We additionally replicate two of our
 top three signals (BMI and educational attainment) in an external
 cohort, and show that population stratification may have confounded GWAS
 summary statistics for height in the GIANT cohort. Our results provide a
 flexible and powerful framework for evolutionary analysis of complex
 phenotypes in humans and other species, and offer insights into the

However, while the effects of mutational load on global viral populations have been considered, its quantitative effects at the within-host scale of infection are less well understood. We here show that even on the rapid timescale of acute disease, mutational load has an effect on within-host viral adaptation, reducing the effective selection acting upon beneficial variants by similar to 10 per cent. Furthermore, mutational load induces considerable stochasticity in the pattern of evolution, causing a more than five-fold uncertainty in the effective fitness of a transmitted beneficial variant. Our work aims to bridge the gap between classic models from population genetic theory and the biology of viral infection. In an advance on some previous models of mutational load, we replace the assumption of a constant variant fitness cost with an experimentally-derived distribution of fitness effects. Expanding previous frameworks for evolutionary simulation, we introduce the Wright-Fisher model with continuous mutation, which describes a continuum of possible modes of replication within a cell. Our results advance our understanding of adaptation in the context of strong selection and a high mutation rate. Despite viral populations having large absolute sizes, critical events in viral adaptation, including antigenic drift and the onset of drug resistance, arise through stochastic evolutionary processes.}},

   spontaneous mutations are fundamental to our understanding of the
   evolutionary process. To gain insights into the molecular and fitness
   consequences of spontaneous mutations, we conducted a mutation
   accumulation (MA) experiment at varying population sizes in the nematode
   Caenorhabditis elegans, evolving 35 lines in parallel for 409
   generations at three population sizes (N = 1, 10, and 100 individuals).
   Here, we focus on nuclear SNPs and small insertion/deletions (indels)
   under minimal influence of selection, as well as their accrual rates in
   larger populations under greater selection efficacy. The spontaneous
   rates of base substitutions and small indels are 1.84 (95\% C.I. +/-
   0.14) x 10(-9) substitutions and 6.84 (95\% C.I. +/- 0.97) x 10(-10)
   changes/site/generation, respectively. Small indels exhibit a deletion
   bias with deletions exceeding insertions by threefold. Notably, there
   was no correlation between the frequency of base substitutions,
   nonsynonymous substitutions, or small indels with population size. These
   results contrast with our previous analysis of mitochondrial DNA
   mutations and nuclear copy-number changes in these MA lines, and suggest
   that nuclear base substitutions and small indels are under less
   stringent purifying selection compared to the former mutational classes.
   A transition bias was observed in exons as was a near universal base
   substitution bias toward A/T. Strongly context-dependent base
   substitutions, where 5 `-Ts and 3 `-As increase the frequency of A/T ->
   T/A transversions, especially at the boundaries of A or T homopolymeric
   runs, manifest as higher mutation rates in (i) introns and intergenic
   regions relative to exons, (ii) chromosomal cores vs. arms and tips, and
   (iii) germline-expressed genes.}},

   regions. In most cases, GC skew should not affect conserved amino acids
   because natural selection will purge deleterious alleles. However, in
   the gerbil subfamily of rodents, several conserved genes have undergone
   radical alteration in association with strong GC skew. An extreme
   example concerns the highly conserved homeobox gene Pdx1, which is
   uniquely divergent and GC rich in the sand rat Psammomys obesus and
   close relatives. Here, we investigate the antagonistic interplay between
   very rare amino acid changes driven by GC skew and the force of natural
   selection. Using ectopic protein expression in cell culture, pulse-chase
   labeling, in vitro mutagenesis, and drug treatment, we compare
   properties of mouse and sand rat Pdx1 proteins. We find that amino acid
   change driven by GC skew resulted in altered protein stability, with a
   significantly longer protein half-life for sand rat Pdx1. Using a
   reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, MG132, we find that sand rat
   and mouse Pdx1 are both degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome
   pathway. However, in vitro mutagenesis reveals this pathway operates
   through different amino acid residues. We propose that GC skew caused
   loss of a key ubiquitination site, conserved through vertebrate
   evolution, and that sand rat Pdx1 evolved or fixed a new ubiquitination
   site to compensate. Our results give molecular insight into the power of
   natural selection in the face of maladaptive changes driven by strong GC

   are directionally biased, shifting trait means in a particular
   direction, or if mutation generates more variance in some directions of
   multivariate trait space than others, mutation itself might be a source
   of bias in phenotypic evolution. Here, we use mutagenesis to investigate
   the affect of mutation on trait mean and (co)variances in zebrafish,
   Danio rerio. Mutation altered the relationship between age and both
   prolonged swimming speed and body shape. These observations suggest that
   mutational effects on ontogeny or aging have the potential to generate
   variance across the phenome. Mutations had a far greater effect in males
   than females, although whether this is a reflection of sex-specific
   ontogeny or aging remains to be determined. In males, mutations
   generated positive covariance between swimming speed, size, and body
   shape suggesting the potential for mutation to affect the evolutionary
   covariation of these traits. Overall, our observations suggest that
   mutation does not generate equal variance in all directions of
   phenotypic space or in each sex, and that pervasive variation in
   ontogeny or aging within a cohort could affect the variation available

  abstract                   = {{Identifying driver mutations in cancer is notoriously difficult. To
   date, recurrence of a mutation in patients remains one of the most
   reliable markers of mutation driver status. However, some mutations are
   more likely to occur than others due to differences in background
   mutation rates arising from various forms of infidelity of DNA
   replication and repair machinery, endogenous, and exogenous mutagens. We
   calculated nucleotide and codon mutability to study the contribution of
   background processes in shaping the observed mutational spectrum in
   cancer. We developed and tested probabilistic pan-cancer and
   cancer-specific models that adjust the number of mutation recurrences in
   patients by background mutability in order to find mutations which may
   be under selection in cancer. We showed that mutations with higher
   mutability values had higher observed recurrence frequency, especially
   in tumor suppressor genes. This trend was prominent for nonsense and
   silent mutations or mutations with neutral functional impact. In
   oncogenes, however, highly recurring mutations were characterized by
   relatively low mutability, resulting in an inversed U-shaped trend.
   Mutations not yet observed in any tumor had relatively low mutability
   values, indicating that background mutability might limit mutation
   occurrence. We compiled a dataset of missense mutations from 58 genes
   with experimentally validated functional and transforming impacts from
   various studies. We found that mutability of driver mutations was lower
   than that of passengers and consequently adjusting mutation recurrence
   frequency by mutability significantly improved ranking of mutations and
   driver mutation prediction. Even though no training on existing data was
   involved, our approach performed similarly or better to the
   state-of-the-art methods.
   Author summary Cancer development and progression is associated with
   accumulation of mutations. However, only a small fraction of mutations
   identified in a patient is responsible for cellular transformations
   leading to cancer. These so-called drivers characterize molecular
   profiles of tumors and could be helpful in predicting clinical outcomes
   for the patients. One of the major problems in cancer research is
   prioritizing mutations. Recurrence of a mutation in patients remains one
   of the most reliable markers of its driver status. However, DNA damage
   and repair processes do not affect the genome uniformly, and some
   mutations are more likely to occur than others. Moreover, mutational
   probability (mutability) varies with the cancer type. We developed
   models that adjust the number of mutation recurrences in patients by
   cancer-type specific background mutability in order to prioritize cancer
   mutations. Using a comprehensive experimental dataset, we found that
   mutability of driver mutations was lower than that of passengers, and
   consequently adjusting mutation recurrence frequency by mutability
   significantly improved ranking of mutations and driver mutation
   prediction.}},

  abstract                   = {{We propose an integro-differential description of the dynamics of the
   fitness distribution in an asexual population under mutation and
   selection, in the presence of a phenotype optimum. Due to the presence
   of this optimum, the distribution of mutation effects on fitness depends
   on the parent's fitness, leading to a non-standard equation with
   `context-dependent' mutation kernels. Under general assumptions on the
   mutation kernels, which encompass the standard n - dimensional Gaussian
   Fisher's geometrical model (FGM), we prove that the equation admits a
   unique time-global solution. Furthermore, we derive a nonlocal nonlinear
   transport equation satisfied by the cumulant generating function of the
   fitness distribution. As this equation is the same as the equation
   derived by Martin and Rogues (2016) while studying stochastic
   Wright-Fisher-type models, this shows that the solution of the main
   integro-differential equation can be interpreted as the expected
   distribution of fitness corresponding to this type of microscopic
   models, in a deterministic limit. Additionally, we give simple
   sufficient conditions for the existence/non-existence of a concentration
   phenomenon at the optimal fitness value, i.e. of a Dirac mass at the
   optimum in the stationary fitness distribution. We show how it
   determines a phase transition, as mutation rates increase, in the value
   of the equilibrium mean fitness at mutation-selection balance. In the
   particular case of the FGM, consistently with previous studies based on
   other formalisms (Waxman and Peck, 1998, 2006), the condition for the
   existence of the concentration phenomenon simply requires that the
   dimension n of the phenotype space be larger than or equal to 3 and the
   mutation rate U be smaller than some explicit threshold.
   The accuracy of these deterministic approximations are further checked
   by stochastic individual-based simulations.}},

   generic mode of phenotypic interference that couples the function of
   individual genes and the population's global evolutionary dynamics.
   Biological implications of phenotypic interference include rapid
   collateral system degradation in adaptation experiments and long-term
   selection against genome complexity: each additional gene carries a cost
   proportional to the total number of genes. Recombination above a
   threshold rate can eliminate this cost, which establishes a universal,

  comment   = {Venkataram et al acknowledge that decline in fitness is a thing, but they don't say anything about what causes that decline, i.e. diminishing returns epistasis or running out of mutations. This is important because a consequence of diminishing returns epistasis (depending on the decline) is that U>s is possible if NU>>1 to begin with. They mention that adaptation is driven by mutations with fitness effects above a certain threshold and cite 25, 29, 30. Citation 25 is barton - linkage and the limits to natural selection, citation 29 - ben's 2012 paper, and 30 - schiffels - emergent neutrality in adaptive asexual evolution. I should probably glance at these since might go against what my paper is claiming. Venkataram et al also describe the evolutionary stalling phenomena as the thing that happens when beneficial mutations reach an effect size below this clonal interference threshold. I am still not clear on what this clonal interference threshold is (go back and see what they define it as).  This is probably the things worth addressing most in the paper. If this clonal interference threshold exist, then what is that threshold according to past papers and what is it according to what out simulations predict?
If we had a diminishing returns / running out of mutations model, then we could chracterize this evolutionary stalling thing mathematically. What would be interesting is to see that it leads to a a ladder type phenomena, with a sequence of stalls until the optimums are reached. Line 118 of draft mentions other fitness components unrelated to growth rate. Fitness is sort of stated in table 1, and percent identity from EF-Tu orign species is given in table as well with strains used E, S, Y, V, A, P (E is the control strain). See figure S1. Here are some parameters to consider, 1e7 was the bottleneck size. another thing worth onsidering is th enumber of adaptive mutations they found, about 178 total and 38 of them were TM related. So there are 6 strains mentioned above with 6 replicates among the 6 founders.
Results - 178 adaptive mutations, 28 genes (multi-hit, 6 were TM specific out of 215 possible TM specific genes representing 4 percent of E coli genome). Okay, my big questions so far are 1) what is the clonal interference threshold and how is it highlighted in this paper (estimated)? 2) what is being presented in figure 3b and how does that demonstrate evolutionary stalling.
Another interesting that comes from this work is that we've been considering a single s question, which for me is something we should think about. We could instead be asking about whether a short-tailed DFE versus fat-trailed DFE can compete with different total mutation rates?

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of virus mutation rates are important to understand the evolution of the viruses and to combat them. However, methods of estimation are varied and often complex. Here, we critically review over 40 original studies and establish criteria to facilitate comparative analyses. The mutation rates of 23 viruses are presented as substitutions per nucleotide per cell infection (s/n/c) and corrected for selection bias where necessary, using a new statistical method. The resulting rates range from 10-8 to10-6 s/n/c for DNA viruses and from 10-6 to 10-4 s/n/c for RNA viruses. Similar to what has been shown previously for DNA viruses, there appears to be a negative correlation between mutation rate and genome size among RNA viruses, but this result requires further experimental testing. Contrary to some suggestions, the mutation rate of retroviruses is not lower than that of other RNA viruses. We also show that nucleotide substitutions are on average four times more common than insertions/deletions (indels). Finally, we provide estimates of the mutation rate per nucleotide per strand copying, which tends to be lower than that per cell infection because some viruses undergo several rounds of copying per cell, particularly double-stranded DNA viruses. A regularly updated virus mutation rate data set will be available at www.uv.es/rsanjuan/virmut.},

As a result, beneficial mutations on different backgrounds experience competition, or ``clonal interference,'' that can cause asexual populations to evolve more slowly than their sexual counterparts. Factors such as a large population size (N) and high mutation rates (\mu) increase the number of competing beneficial mutations, and hence are expected to increase the intensity of clonal interference. However, recent theory suggests that, with very large values of N\mu, the severity of clonal interference may instead decline. The reason is that, with large N\mu, genomes including both beneficial mutations are rapidly created by recurrent mutation, obviating the need for recombination. Here, we analyze data from experimentally evolved asexual populations of a bacteriophage and find that, in these nonrecombining populations with very large N\mu, recurrent mutation does appear to ameliorate this cost of asexuality.}},

  abstract  = {Author Summary One of the most fundamental tradeoffs in evolutionary biology is between survival and reproduction. Many parasites experience distinct selective pressures during different stages of their life cycles; mutations arising during one stage may be beneficial, but come at a cost during another. For example, many viruses experience favorable growth conditions within a host punctuated with harsh conditions outside the host during transmission. We conducted an evolution experiment with a ssDNA microvirid bacteriophage selecting for growth within the host and capsid stability outside the host in the presence of extreme environmental conditions (low pH or high temperature), and we hypothesized detection of a tradeoff between reproduction and survival. We found that individual mutations gained under rapidly fluctuating selective pressures similar to those experienced by pathogens increased both growth rate and capsid stability; tradeoffs were completely absent. We compared the effects of beneficial mutations gained in response to selection for growth rate alone and found the expected tradeoffs on capsid stability. Tradeoffs therefore arise when selection is not working to avoid them. Otherwise, payoffs prevail.},

Here, we investigate the underlying distribution of fitness effects of beneficial mutations that natural selection acts on during the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the opportunistic human pathogen P. aeruginosa. When the fitness of the wild type is high, most beneficial mutations have small effects. This finding is consistent with existing population genetic models of adaptation based on statistical theory. When the fitness of the wild type is low, most beneficial mutations have large effects. This distribution cannot be explained by population genetic theory, but it can be readily understood by considering the biochemical basis of resistance. This study confirms an important prediction of population genetic theory, and it highlights the need to integrate statistical and biochemical approaches to adaptation in order to understand evolution in stressful environments, such as those provided by antibiotics.},

Robert et al. used a single-cell technology to visualize the accumulation of new mutations. The method identifies DNA sequences with mispaired bases and small insertions or deletions caused by DNA replication errors in living Escherichia coli cells. Following the fates of cells after mutation allowed for a precise quantification of the effects of new mutations. A smaller fraction of mutations were found to be deleterious than predicted previously from indirect observations.Science, this issue p. 1283Mutations have been investigated for more than a century but remain difficult to observe directly in single cells, which limits the characterization of their dynamics and fitness effects. By combining microfluidics, time-lapse imaging, and a fluorescent tag of the mismatch repair system in Escherichia coli, we visualized the emergence of mutations in single cells, revealing Poissonian dynamics. Concomitantly, we tracked the growth and life span of single cells, accumulating ~20,000 mutations genome-wide over hundreds of generations. This analysis revealed that 1% of mutations were lethal; nonlethal mutations displayed a heavy-tailed distribution of fitness effects and were dominated by quasi-neutral mutations with an average cost of 0.3%. Our approach has enabled the investigation of single-cell individuality in mutation rate, mutation fitness costs, and mutation interactions.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the rate and nature of spontaneous mutation is fundamental to understanding evolutionary and molecular processes. In this report, we analyze spontaneous mutations accumulated over thousands of generations by wild-type Escherichia coli and a derivative defective in mismatch repair (MMR), the primary pathway for correcting replication errors. The major conclusions are (i) the mutation rate of a wild-type E. coli strain is ~1 x 10-3 per genome per generation; (ii) mutations in the wild-type strain have the expected mutational bias for G:C &amp;gt; A:T mutations, but the bias changes to A:T &amp;gt; G:C mutations in the absence of MMR; (iii) during replication, A:T &amp;gt; G:C transitions preferentially occur with A templating the lagging strand and T templating the leading strand, whereas G:C &amp;gt; A:T transitions preferentially occur with C templating the lagging strand and G templating the leading strand; (iv) there is a strong bias for transition mutations to occur at 5'ApC3'/3'TpG5' sites (where bases 5'A and 3'T are mutated) and, to a lesser extent, at 5'GpC3'/3'CpG5' sites (where bases 5'G and 3'C are mutated); (v) although the rate of small (<=4 nt) insertions and deletions is high at repeat sequences, these events occur at only 1/10th the genomic rate of base-pair substitutions. MMR activity is genetically regulated, and bacteria isolated from nature often lack MMR capacity, suggesting that modulation of MMR can be adaptive. Thus, comparing results from the wild-type and MMR-defective strains may lead to a deeper understanding of factors that determine mutation rates and spectra, how these factors may differ among organisms, and how they may be shaped by environmental conditions.},

  abstract  = {Author Summary Although mutations with positive effect on fitness are rare, they contribute disproportionally to evolution, because they are favored by natural selection. Because they are rare and hard to study experimentally, little is known about the frequency and variation in fitness effects of beneficial mutations, and it is often assumed that their effects follow an exponential distribution. We quantified the total number of beneficial mutations and their effects on resistance for an enzyme that is the main target of resistance against the antibiotic cefotaxime. Based on 48 unique beneficial mutations identified among more than 300 sequenced mutants, we estimate that at least 87 of the 2,583 possible point mutations (3.4%) in this enzyme are beneficial. We measured survival of these mutants on a range of antibiotic concentrations and derived estimates of resistance and fitness. The recovered distribution deviates from an exponential distribution due to the presence of a few mutants with a very large effect. The existence of such mutations will increase the predictability of adaptation and shorten the length of adaptive pathways.},

  abstract  = {Summary Evolutionary success of bacteria relies on the constant fine-tuning of their mutation rates, which optimizes their adaptability to constantly changing environmental conditions. When adaptation is limited by the mutation supply rate, under some conditions, natural selection favours increased mutation rates by acting on allelic variation of the genetic systems that control fidelity of DNA replication and repair. Mutator alleles are carried to high frequency through hitchhiking with the adaptive mutations they generate. However, when fitness gain no longer counterbalances the fitness loss due to continuous generation of deleterious mutations, natural selection favours reduction of mutation rates. Selection and counter-selection of high mutation rates depends on many factors: the number of mutations required for adaptation, the strength of mutator alleles, bacterial population size, competition with other strains, migration, and spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. Such modulations of mutation rates may also play a role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance.},

Each strain is Lac- and reverts to Lac+ only by restoring the glutamic acid codon. The strains have been designed so that each reverts via one of the six base substitutions. The set of strains allows detection of each transition and transversion simply by monitoring the Lac- to Lac+ frequency, as demonstrated here with characterized mutagens and mutator alleles. These strains are useful for rapidly determining the mutagenic specificity of mutagens at a single site, for detecting low levels of stimulation of certain base substitutions, for monitoring specific base changes in response to various experimental conditions or strain backgrounds, and for isolating new mutator strains.},

  abstract = {Strand misalignments at DNA repeats during replication are implicated in mutational hotspots. To study these events, we have generated strains carrying mutations in the Escherichia coli chromosomal lacZ gene that revert via deletion of a short duplicated sequence or by template switching within imperfect inverted repeat (quasipalindrome, QP) sequences. Using these strains, we demonstrate that mutation of the distal repeat of a quasipalindrome, with respect to replication fork movement, is about 10-fold higher than the proximal repeat, consistent with more common template switching on the leading strand. The leading strand bias was lost in the absence of exonucleases I and VII, suggesting that it results from more efficient suppression of template switching by 3' exonucleases targeted to the lagging strand. The loss of 3' exonucleases has no effect on strand misalignment at direct repeats to produce deletion. To compare these events to other mutations, we have reengineered reporters (designed by Cupples and Miller 1989) that detect specific base substitutions or frameshifts in lacZ with the reverting lacZ locus on the chromosome rather than an F' element. This set allows rapid screening of potential mutagens, environmental conditions, or genetic loci for effects on a broad set of mutational events. We found that hydroxyurea (HU), which depletes dNTP pools, slightly elevated templated mutations at inverted repeats but had no effect on deletions, simple frameshifts, or base substitutions. Mutations in nucleotide diphosphate kinase, ndk, significantly elevated simple mutations but had little effect on the templated class. Zebularine, a cytosine analog, elevated all classes.},

  abstract = {One of the most intriguing puzzles in biology is the degree to which evolution is repeatable. The repeatability of evolution, or parallel evolution, has been studied in a variety of model systems, but has rarely been investigated with clinically relevant viruses. To investigate parallel evolution of HIV-1, we passaged two replicate HIV-1 populations for almost 1 year in each of two human T-cell lines. For each of the four evolution lines, we determined the genetic composition of the viral population at nine time points by deep sequencing the entire genome. Mutations that were carried by the majority of the viral population accumulated continuously over 1 year in each evolution line. Many majority mutations appeared in more than one evolution line, that is, our experiments showed an extreme degree of parallel evolution. In one of the evolution lines, 62% of the majority mutations also occur in another line. The parallelism impairs our ability to reconstruct the evolutionary history by phylogenetic methods. We show that one can infer the correct phylogenetic topology by including minority mutations in our analysis. We also find that mutation diversity at the beginning of the experiment is predictive of the frequency of majority mutations at the end of the experiment.},
